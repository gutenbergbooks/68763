  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Not wishing my readers to be falsely impressed on
perusing this novel, I wish to inform them that this
is a story of the impossible, and is placed in the
future for the sake of convenience. Were England
other than she is, however, it would not be so
impossible to issue such an edict as I have here
introduced; and therefore it is a matter of congratulation
and deep thankfulness to both Jew and
Gentile that the attitude of our country towards
her Jewish subjects is that of justice, toleration,
and friendliness. At the same time, the poisonous
seeds of anti-Semitism are so subtle and so easily
instilled, that a warning—even in the form of fiction—may
not be out of place.</p>

<p class='c009'>With regard to the practical side of the story, I
claim the author’s privilege of imagination; since
this is not a treatise on Zionism, but merely a
novel.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER I<br /> OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was the Day of Atonement—the Great White
Fast. The principal synagogue in the West End of
London was crowded from the doors to the Ark, and
the heat was intense. Like a flock of frightened sheep,
those Jews—and they were many—who ignored the
claims of public worship for over eleven months at a
stretch, rushed to the synagogue on this Holy Day in
order to settle their accounts with an offended Deity,
and obtain exemption from service for yet another
year. This Day served as a test to prove whether a
man of Hebrew birth clung to the Jewish faith or
not; for if he retained the very smallest respect for
the tenets of his religion, he would at least put in
an appearance at the synagogue, and refrain from
tasting food. However lax he might be throughout
the year, on this Day he would try to make reparation,
lest he should be struck off from the inheritance
of Israel; for if he failed to observe <em>Yom Kippur</em>,
he could no longer claim—amongst his own people—to
be a Jew.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>People are apt to speak of “the Jews” as though
they were one nation of one unvaried character, and
in so doing they make a fatal mistake. The fact that
Jews possess in a large measure the chameleon-like
faculty of reflecting the colour—or rather the characteristics—of
the country wherein they happen to
reside is entirely overlooked. No wider divergence
of opinion and character between that possessed by
the English Jew and the Polish Jew, between the
educated and the ignorant, could be imagined; yet
by the easy-going Gentile the whole heterogeneous
mass of the race of Israel is summed up in one
category—“The Jews.” Even in this small gathering
of modern Israelites there were many different types.
There was the old man, clad in his burial garments,
and slipperless, who swayed to and fro and smote his
breast with the zeal of a devotee; there was—up in
the gallery—the equally old woman, her head disfigured
by the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">scheitel</span></i><a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> (tabooed by the modern
Jewish matron), which she wore as the mark of her
wifehood. There was the opulent Jew, newly
imported from South Africa, with his consort
above him; the diamond merchant from Holland;
the English stockbroker; the German commercial
traveller; the Oxford under-graduate. There was
the vulgar Jewish matron, with her insufferable air
of affluence and her display of diamonds; and the
refined Jewish lady, with her less conspicuous attire
and quieter manner. There were men and women
of all nationalities and classes, bound together by one
common tie, yet in temperament as opposite as the
poles. And out of this crowd of more or less fervent
worshippers there is but one who claims our attention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>a man of religious views so broad as to be almost
heterodox, yet still in his conformity to the
fundamental principles of his religion, a faithful
Jew.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Wig.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He belonged to one of the noblest Jewish families
in England. Descended from the Sephardim, his
ancestors had come over in the reign of Charles II.,
and his forefathers for generations had been therefore
of English birth. The Selim Montellas were famous
throughout the land for their wealth, their munificence
in disposing of it, and their devotion to their
country and its sovereign ruler. Lionel, the last of
the race, proved no less worthy a representative of
the ancient house. After a brilliant career at Oxford,
where he had earned the respect of both dons and
under-graduates for his adherence to the rules of his
religion, he had entered Parliament as member for
Thorpe Burstall—where his father possessed an estate.
He was one of the youngest men in the House, but
possessed a clear-sightedness beyond his age. His
youth served to intensify rather than detract from
the interest he instilled into his political duties.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after he left the university that his religious
views underwent a change. From orthodoxy he
drifted into reform—a reform which was dangerously
akin to Rationalism, and then putting a stern check
upon himself, he adopted a belief not unlike that of
the Karaites. He tried to reject the Talmud and the
whole authority of tradition, and to adhere only to
the written Law; but finding this unsatisfactory, he
was gradually making his way back to conventional
Judaism once again. That accounted for his presence
in the synagogue on this solemn occasion, for
whatever his views on the lesser details of the faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>might be, on <em>Yom Kippur</em> he was as strict as the
most orthodox of his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was about two o’clock in the afternoon, and
vitality in the synagogue was at a somewhat low ebb.
Most of the children, and those of their elders who
were too delicate to sustain the rigours of an absolute
fast, had gone home to lunch, leaving their stricter
co-religionists to satisfy the cravings of hunger by
naught but spiritual refreshment. It was in the
gallery where the ordeal was found most severe,
for the ladies possessed less staying power than
the more hardy men; moreover, the mere fact of
having to refrain from the gossip in which they
delighted was in itself a trial of no little magnitude.
Their faces showed signs of weariness and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, and
the air of smartness which had been theirs at the
beginning of the service had almost disappeared.
Two or three of them created a diversion by fainting—the
majority of them were too healthy to swoon.
They sat still, and counted the hours and minutes to
nightfall; it seemed as if the Fast would never end.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the quietest part of the service a noise from the
street was heard. A number of boys were calling out
the afternoon editions of the newspapers, but although
their voices floated in through the open windows, the
substance of their announcement was lost. Lionel
Montella almost unconsciously raised his head to
listen, for he was always on the alert for new tidings
of any kind, but the peculiar enunciation of the
newspaper boys baffled even his acute ear. All he
could make out was the word “death.” Who was
dead he had not the faintest idea.</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised his prayer-book, and applied himself
with renewed diligence to the text. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>saying the <em>Ameedah</em>, and he repeated the responses
with the rest of the congregation; but all the time
the word “death” was at the back of his mind. It
worried him so much that he was unable to give his
undivided attention to the service, and when the
newspaper boys repassed the synagogue, he listened
to their shouts with all the intensity of which he was
capable. He could not help feeling—perhaps it was
a premonition—that the death was an important one,
that it affected him in some way he could not define;
and when at last he caught the name, the surprise
which he ought to have experienced was absent—only
the deep, inexpressible horror remained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Death of Mr. Lawrence Campbell!... Sudden
death of the Premier!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The words fell on the ears of the congregation like
a knell. The reader paused almost imperceptibly in
his chanting, the majority of the people looked at
each other in horrified surprise. The name of
Lawrence Campbell was synonymous with all that
was noble and good, and as a loyal friend of the
Jews, he had ever earned their respect and affection.
Although he had occupied the high office of Prime
Minister for over ten years, he was comparatively a
young man, and his death came as a totally unexpected
blow. What it would mean to the community
remained to be seen, but like a sudden ray of light
the possible consequence flashed across Lionel
Montella’s mind. He sank on to his seat with
his brain in a whirl, and in spite of the temporary
feeling of weakness brought on by his long hours
of fasting, tried to think clearly. He alone of all his
co-religionists knew the true and perilous position of
the Jews in modern Europe at the present day. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Alien Immigration question had reached a crisis which
would have to be settled at Parliament’s next session,
and the issue practically depended on the unreliable
temper of the Government. Various expedients for
colonisation had been tried without success, for the
Jews, never having been “hewers of wood and
drawers of water,” did not take kindly to the manual
labour necessitated by such colonisation. What form
the next experiment would take, therefore, was a
difficult and vexed question, and one which the
Premier and his subordinate, Montella, had been
threshing out together for weeks. And now
Lawrence Campbell, the chief, almost the only,
enthusiastic champion of the Jews in Great Britain
was dead. No wonder the young politician’s heart
grew faint within him!</p>

<p class='c009'>The signal that the long day’s service was at an
end—the blowing of the ram’s horn—recalled him
to himself; and folding up his talith, he made his
way with the others to the vestibule. The refreshing
breeze from the street came as a blessed relief after
the close atmosphere of the interior of the synagogue,
and he leant against the balustrade for a moment
before searching for his hansom. All around him the
people were dispersing, and as he listened to their
kindly greetings to each other, he realised the close
bond of unity—more evident in the Jewish than in
any other faith—which drew them together with
irresistible force. A few of the men with whom he
was acquainted came up to him to shake hands.
One—the treasurer of the synagogue—lingered for a
few moments’ conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sudden thing this—death of the Premier,” he
remarked, attacking the subject which was uppermost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in his mind. “Heart failure, Cohen says. Struck
down all in a minute. Bad thing for the Chosen,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, very,” Montella returned seriously, with
emphasis on the words. “I saw poor Campbell only
last week. I had no idea that he was subject to
heart attacks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor I either. I am sorry—very sorry. Campbell
was the right man in the right place, and a difficult
place it is nowadays. Can you tell me who will be
likely to succeed him in the premiership?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A little knot of men gathered round him as he
put the question, leaving their women-folk to hasten
towards home and food. Lionel Montella had been
singled out and recognised, and the opportunity of
rubbing shoulders with him and listening to his
words was too valuable to be passed by. That they
were personally unacquainted with him mattered not
in the least, and he was so used to being lionised that
he did not dream of considering their curiosity
impertinent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know?” he said slowly, with a slight
tremor of agitation in his voice. “The successor to
Lawrence Campbell will be the very last man we
want to see in power. I mean Athelstan Moore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Athelstan Moore—the avowed anti-Semite and
rabid Jew-hater, a man who possessed the dangerous
power of swaying men’s minds by the force of his
rhetoric, of fascinating them by the strength of his
personality, of completely subjugating them by the
influence of his invincible will. No wonder a thrill
ran through the hearts of the people as Montella
pronounced the name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That rabid enemy of the Jews!” exclaimed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>treasurer, in dismay. “Why, the lives of our poorer
brethren will not be worth twopence if he is at the
head of the State.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella’s face was more expressive than he knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must not make trouble for ourselves,” he said,
his words belying the troubled expression in his eyes.
“We must hope that Moore is not so black as he’s
painted. After all, he’s only a man, and even as chief
Minister of State he can’t do more than exercise
powers which are distinctly limited. Unfortunately,
since the influx of Roumanian immigrants at the
beginning of the century, anti-Jewish feeling among
the masses has been increasingly strong. I’m afraid
that it’s the impolitic and regrettable behaviour of
the immigrants themselves which has brought this
about. It has needed all our strength to counteract
this feeling, and I am afraid it will need more than
ever now. One thing we must make up our minds to
do, and that is to stand by each other, no matter
what our social position may be. We must remember
the old truism that ‘Unity is strength.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another eager listener had joined the group.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think it possible that Athelstan Moore may
direct his spite against the upper and middle classes
of Jewish society as well as the sweaters and aliens
of the East End?” he asked, with a slightly foreign
accent. “Or shall we be, as law-abiding citizens,
exempt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot say,” Montella replied, with hesitation.
“In so far as the Jewish question includes the effect
of Jewish influence upon the trade and commerce of
the country, it concerns all classes from the highest
to the lowest. But, friends, it is getting late; and
we are most of us faint from want of food. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>consequence of poor Campbell’s death is in anyway
serious, we must call a meeting in order to discuss
the situation. For the present, I think we should
disperse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had noticed the beadle waiting to switch off
the light and bolt the doors. It was characteristic of
the young member to avoid causing inconvenience to
any person; and in this case he could see that the
synagogal officer was weary from his arduous duties,
and anxious to be gone. So he shook hands with
each one of his willing hearers, and bade them all
farewell. Then he signalled to his waiting hansom,
and was driven rapidly away.</p>

<p class='c009'>The treasurer watched the vehicle until it was out
of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine chap—Montella,” he said to a friend who
stood near by. “One of the good old stock, and not
ashamed to own it either. He’ll give that devil
Moore a <em>potch</em> if anyone can. He’s got plenty of
brain and heart and grit in him, or my name’s not
Jacob Schlapp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friend’s enthusiasm was less effusive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will discuss Lal Montella when we’ve put
something inside us,” he rejoined, taking the treasurer’s
arm. “Have you forgotten that it was <em>Yom Kippur</em>
to-day?”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> THE MONTELLAS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Montellas, in spite of their being the owners of
a mansion in Portland Place, chose to occupy a flat
in Knightsbridge, and to let their house to someone
who had more use for the magnificent rooms and
galleries than themselves. Ten years ago they had
been renowned for their lavish hospitality and
brilliant receptions; but a paralytic stroke having
suddenly attacked Sir Julian when at the zenith of
his popularity, they had been obliged to forego the
pleasures of entertaining, and to retire into private
life. The terrible affliction which had come upon
her husband seemed also to have shattered Lady
Montella’s health; and always more or less invalided,
she seldom ventured forth into the maze of society.
Whenever she made an effort to be present at some
function, it was only for the sake of her son; for
Lionel, being her only surviving child, was the lodestar
of her existence. All her thoughts, hopes, and
prayers were centred on him; and that he responded
so faithfully to the influence of her training was the
greatest joy she possessed. Had he proved otherwise,
he would most surely have broken her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was twilight, the hour her ladyship loved the
best. She was reclining in an easy-chair near the
window, with her hands loosely folded, and her eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>watching the dying glory of the sunset. There was
a vague something in her attitude which indicated
peace—peace and contentment. It was as if she had
been through all the storm and stress of life, and found
a haven at the end. There were traces of suffering
on her forehead, surmounted by its coronal of white
hair; but the curves of her lips, and the indefinable
sweetness of their expression, showed that she was
neither embittered by sorrow nor hardened by
experience. As wife and mother, as hostess and
poor man’s friend, her interests had ever been
concentrated outside herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tinkling bells of a clock in the adjoining room
disturbed her reverie, and at the same moment the
door opened to admit a girl. Pausing a moment to
switch on the electric light, she advanced towards
Lady Montella’s chair. Her step, elastic yet firm,
indicated the exuberance of youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A penny for your thoughts, auntie. You look
like Patience on a monument,” she said merrily,
sinking on to a little chair at her ladyship’s side.
“Are you still lamenting your sins, or have you, like
myself, put them away for another year? I am so
glad Dr. Ford allowed me to fast for half the day.
My appetite is keener than it has been for weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella looked at the girl and smiled.
Raie Emanuel was her niece only by adoption, but
there was as deep an affection on both sides as if a
blood relationship had existed between the two.
Raie, in keeping with her name, constituted a ray of
brightness in a somewhat silent household, and to its
mistress was a source of comfort and delight. The
eldest daughter of a large but impecunious family,
her nature was a combination of practicality with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>romance. She could cook a dinner or compose a
poem with equal facility, and although in Lady
Montella’s menage the former accomplishment was
never required, it was to the girl’s credit that the
ability was there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lionel ought to be here soon,” she ran on, scarcely
waiting for an answer, “unless he calls at Grosvenor
Square on the way. I wonder which he wants most:
the Lady Patricia or his breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must be tired and hungry after his long day’s
fast,” her foster-aunt returned. “I hope he will come
straight home. You are joking, Raie, in saying that.
Have you any grounds for supposing that Lady
Patricia is the special object of my son’s interest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.” The girl nodded vivaciously. “One has
only to see them together to be sure of it. Patricia
Byrne is Lionel’s ideal woman—fair to look upon,
fair at heart. And Lionel is Lady Patricia’s hero, as
indeed he deserves to be. Haven’t you noticed the
change which has come over him lately—the change
in his opinions about women, I mean? Until a few
weeks ago he was absorbed in his politics and his
poor Jews. Now there is a counter attraction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella looked distressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are more observant than I am, Raie,” she
rejoined. “I have noticed nothing; perhaps I did
not wish to notice—this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She leant back in her chair, her hands interlocked.
For some unaccountable reason she had not thought
that her boy would go the usual way of youth, and
entangle himself in a love-affair; he had always
seemed much too serious and reserved for anything
of the kind. Of course, she wanted him to marry
some day—a girl of his own faith whom she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>choose. To allow himself to fall in love with Lady
Patricia Byrne was the height of folly, and could only
bring trouble on all concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you are mistaken, Raie,” she added, at
last. “I don’t think my son would do anything to
give me pain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fond mother who, because she has made an idol
of her son, thinks he is totally devoid of the human
passions which have agitated the breast of youth
ever since the world began. Raie marvelled that a
man should be so little understood by his nearest and
dearest, but she said nothing; and at that moment
the subject of their conversation himself appeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came in with a number of newspapers in his
hand, and having kissed his mother and inquired
how Raie had fasted, informed them of the important
news. He looked tired and worn; and Raie, to
whom the death of premiers was as nothing compared
with nearer and more practical matters, immediately
hurried off to see if his breakfast were fully prepared.
She returned a few minutes later, and insisted on
his going to the dining-room forthwith. She would
listen to nothing he had to say until he had satisfied
the demands of the inner man. She captured the
papers, however, and read the accounts for herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only forty-four years of age,” she remarked, as
she put the last one down. “Well, I suppose he will
have a state funeral; it will be worth seeing. Do
you think you can get us tickets of admission, Lal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Raie!” exclaimed Lady Montella, in a tone of
reproof. “Is that the first thing you think of—not
the serious consequence of the Premier’s death upon
the nation, but only the excitement of watching his
funeral procession?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Lionel glanced at his foster-cousin with
indulgence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind,” he said kindly. “Let Raie leave
state affairs to people who are forced to consider
them. Time enough to be serious when the necessity
occurs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I think,” the girl rejoined, with a
smile. “Auntie takes things much too seriously.
By-the-bye, Lionel, will Lady Chesterwood have to
put off her masked ball?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless she is personally related to poor Campbell,
no. When is it going to be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On Thursday week. I’ve been looking forward
to it for months; it will be my first real ball, you
know. Auntie has given me the loveliest dress you
can imagine; it’s a perfect dream.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a nightmare, I hope,” he returned, and then
drew back his chair. “Well, I must away to
Downing Street, I suppose.” He sighed. “I wish
I could look a year or so ahead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do the days pass too slowly for you, then?”
asked his mother, in a tone of sympathy. “It is not
like you to wish away your time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The days pass too quickly for all I mean to do in
them,” he replied. “It is only because I foresee
trouble in the distance, mother dear. However,
I won’t be a prophet of evil. Let me take a leaf out
of Raie’s book, and put away dull care.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella followed him out into the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will be back soon, I hope, dear?” she said.
“I expect Miss Lorm during the evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will be back as soon as I can,” he returned;
“but I may be detained at Downing Street, and—and
I have promised to call at Grosvenor Square.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“To see Lady Patricia?” Her voice unconsciously
hardened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; Lady Patricia and her father.” A tinge of
colour came into his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mother said no more, but kissing him lightly
on the forehead, went to her room, and rang the bell
for her maid. At dinner she listened to Raie’s light
chatter with her thoughts elsewhere, and when the
meal was at an end, asked the girl for music. Raie
played and sang as well as most girls of her age, and
having once started, was in no hurry to cease. She
amused herself, and in a lesser degree her aunt, until
the footman announced the advent of Miss Lorm.
Then she put her music away in the rack, and rose
to greet the guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah Lorm was a singer who owed her position in
a great measure to Lady Montella’s liberality. She
had been introduced to her ladyship’s notice some
years ago as a young co-religionist who possessed an
exceptional voice, but who lacked the means to ensure
an adequate training; and as Lady Montella loved
to interest herself in such cases, the necessary money
was immediately forthcoming. Zillah went to the
Royal College for three years, after which she studied
in Rome and Paris. Then, through her patroness’s
influence, she secured engagements to sing at
homes and receptions. Now, at the age of five-and-twenty,
she was one of the most popular vocalists in
London.</p>

<p class='c009'>She entered the room with the graceful self-possession
which betokened the artiste. Unusually
tall, and with an inclination towards embonpoint, her
evening-gown of clinging silk concealed, yet at the
same time revealed the rounded curves of her figure.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Her eyes, dark and luminous, wandered restlessly
through the room, as though in quest of someone she
desired to see; her face, as she shook hands with her
patroness and Raie Emanuel, lighted up with a
winning smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My son has had to go to Downing Street on
account of the Premier’s death,” Lady Montella
informed her, although there was no reason why she
should apologise for his absence. “I hope he will
return before you go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie looked questioningly at her foster-aunt, and
invited Miss Lorm to loosen her wraps. For no
accountable reason a feeling of aversion existed
between the two; perhaps it was because the young
girl felt small and insignificant in the presence of
Miss Lorm; and the singer was, or had been, jealous
of the position occupied by Raie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am in luck’s way, Lady Montella,” she said,
settling herself on one of the silk-covered chairs in a
way which made Raie’s movements look awkward in
comparison. “I am to be commanded to sing before
the Queen-Regent early next month.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed?” Her ladyship’s face lit up with
interest. “It is a great honour, Zillah. I am very
glad; I am always glad when a Jewess distinguishes
herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah moved her position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t wish to distinguish myself <em>as a Jewess</em>,”
she replied hastily, with a spot of colour on her cheeks.
“I am a singer, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pur et simple</span></i>. The Queen-Regent
doesn’t know that I’m a Jewess, nor do the powers
that be who managed the affair for me know either.
The name of Jew is in such ill-favour just now that I
have thought it best to sink my connection with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Chosen in case it should prove a hindrance to my
career. Fortunately, although I am dark, my appearance
does not betray me. Do you not think me
wise, dear Lady Montella?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From the worldly point of view, perhaps; but I
would rather have you cling to your precious heritage,
my dear, especially just now, when people are so
ready to seize on anything which can be considered
discreditable to us. My son is doing his utmost to
serve his country, and to prove himself a worthy Jew.
Even those who are the enemies of our people are forced
to honour him. I should like you, in the same way,
to prove yourself a worthy Jewess, and so raise the
standard in public opinion. What do you say,
Raie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie tossed her head. “I—oh, I haven’t the least
respect for a Jew or Jewess who is ashamed to own it!
Besides, the most superficial student of physiognomy
could trace Miss Lorm’s descent in her features. It is
the most difficult thing in the world to hide one’s
Hebrew origin. A look or a word—even a gesture
will show it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah bit her lip to repress a sarcastic rejoinder,
then changed the subject. Secretly she made up her
mind to pay Raie back when opportunity occurred.
Shortly afterwards she rose to take her leave. She
was very fond of dear Lady Montella, but her
ladyship’s dialectics on Judaism bored her
excessively, and the one to whom she liked to
converse was not there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie hailed her departure with relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I must be bad-tempered, auntie,” she remarked,
as soon as the hall door was closed. “At any
rate, Zillah Lorm always rubs me up the wrong way.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Why? I have never heard her say anything to
offend you, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it isn’t what she says; it’s the way she looks
at me. She always makes me say all the sharp
horrid things I can think of. I am thoroughly
ashamed of myself afterwards, but I wouldn’t
apologise for the world. And I know she’s trying
to set her cap at Lionel, and she knows I know it;
and—and—I would much rather Lal married Lady
Patricia than Zillah Lorm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke in the short, nervous way which was
characteristic of herself. Lady Montella glanced at
her musingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid your imagination is running away
with you, Raie,” she returned, in a quiet voice.
“First it is Lady Patricia Byrne, then Zillah Lorm.
To how many more ladies are you going to engage
my son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To me, if you like!” The girl laughed merrily.
“Don’t you think I would make a good wife, auntie?
But no, I am destined to be an old maid! I took the
last piece of bread-and-butter at tea; and that, you
know, is a sure sign.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She kissed her foster-aunt good-night, and danced
along the corridor to her bedroom. Lady Montella
glanced at the clock, and noticed that it was nearly
eleven. She gave a sigh, and wondered what her son
was doing. She thought that on this night—after he
had been fasting all day—he might have stayed at
home.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> PATRICIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, Lionel Montella, having left his card
at Downing Street, re-entered his hansom, and was
driven to Grosvenor Square. The casket which contained
his jewel consisted of a house situated in the
quietest corner; and here the vehicle slackened speed.
Having pulled the great bell, Montella was admitted
by a powdered footman, and shown into one of the
smaller rooms at the back of the hall. Allowing
himself to be divested of his overcoat, he asked to
see the Earl.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an extremely quiet household, in spite of its
grandeur. The Earl was a peculiar individual of
misanthropical temperament, who shut himself up in
his study, and never mixed with the outer world
unless there were some urgent necessity. The death
of his wife some fourteen years ago had given him
ample excuse for eschewing society; and society,
being aware of his crotchety ideas, returned the
compliment by leaving him severely alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The room to which Montella was eventually
conducted was a small turret-chamber approached
by a special staircase from the topmost landing.
There was no electric light here, and the flickering
candle-light cast weird shadows across the stone walls
and tessellated floor. As he entered the room two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>large blackbirds flew towards him, and encircled his
head. The footman waved them away; and flapping
their wings, they returned to their aviary in the
embrasure formed by the window. Then the manservant
retired, to leave Montella alone with the
Earl.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a man just bordering on middle age, but
his bald head and stooping figure gave him the
appearance of the aged. He was bending over a
tank, with the sleeves of his little velvet jacket
turned up. His dress-coat had been carelessly slung
over the back of a chair. The drip of the water into
the tank was the only sound to break the silence.
Montella for the moment remained inert.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the Earl turned round.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—ah—Montella,” he said, with his hands still
in the water. “Roberts announced you, didn’t he?
I was rather—ah—preoccupied. Hope you’ll excuse
my shaking hands. Come here and look at—ah—some
of my work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man did as he was told, and advanced
towards the tank, which proved to be a toning-bath.
Amateur photography was the Earl’s latest hobby,
and one which for a while absorbed all his time. The
photographs floating in the water were principally
views of his country seat, but there were also a few
portraits amongst them. One, of a child of about six
years of age, his lordship picked up and laid in the
palm of his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There!” he exclaimed, in a tone of triumph.
“Can you tell me who that is?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The face in the photograph had moved horribly,
and the eyes were doubled. It might have stood for
any small boy in the kingdom. Montella hesitated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>before replying; but at last he received a happy
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The King!” he exclaimed. “One can scarcely
fail to recognise him. It is the King!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It <em>is</em> the King.” Lord Torrens dipped the print
lovingly in the water once more. “I photographed
him in the grounds of the palace by special permission
of his mother—ah—the Queen-Regent. He was
a terrible little rascal to take—moved all over the
place; but I’ve got a splendid picture of him, don’t
you think so? Of course it wants touching up a bit;
you can understand that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, certainly,” Montella replied, in good faith.
Then he too dipped his hand in the water, and turned
over the prints. He knew that the Earl liked to be
humoured in his hobby, so he proceeded to ply him
with questions relating to the art. Suddenly he gave
an exclamation of pleasure. The portrait of a girl
floated towards him—a girl with wavy hair, whose
tendrils strayed on to a low but intelligent forehead;
with large eyes, set somewhat far apart and full of
expression; with a well-formed nose, short upper-lip
and rounded chin. She was clasping a bunch of roses
against her breast, and a garland of the same flowers
nestled in her hair. “Lady Patricia,” he said, a
softened tone in his voice. “This is the best portrait
of her I have ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl was delighted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, do you really think so?” he returned. “My
daughter is not a good subject for a photograph;
rather too fair, and doesn’t look her best in repose.
However, I flatter myself that I have succeeded in
getting a very happy expression. You must let me
give you a copy when there is one finished.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“You are very kind.” He gazed at the photograph
as if loath to let it go. “There is no gift that would
please me more—unless it were the original herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He dried his hands and paced the room, overcome
by an unwonted nervousness. The Earl had apparently
not noticed the latter part of his speech, for he
went on toning the prints with imperturbability.
Montella, however, intended him to notice it, and
after stalking up and down for some minutes, decided
to take the bull by the horns.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord Torrens,” he began, feeling more agitated
than when he had given his maiden speech in the
House, “I have come here to-night to ask you a
question on the answer to which my whole life’s
happiness depends. Since I have enjoyed the
privilege of your friendship, I have learnt to know
you and your daughter better than would have been
possible in ordinary circumstances. I know that
there are very few who are admitted to the intimacy
of your home life as you have so kindly admitted
me, and therefore I appreciate the privilege all the
more. But to come to the point—I wish to speak of
Lady Patricia. I have seen her constantly during the
past year, and—and—” His flow of words suddenly
broke down. “My lord, you are acquainted with my
family, and I hope by now that you know something
of me personally. Have I your permission to pay
my addresses to your daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The choice little speech he had prepared forsook
his memory just when it was most needed; even in
his own ears the statement of his desire sounded
lame. The Earl turned round slowly, and regarded
him fixedly; but the monosyllable “Eh?” was all
he vouchsafed in reply.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>It is one of the most trying things in the world to
have to repeat a difficult request. Montella began
all over again, and gaining confidence, succeeded
in giving an impassioned appeal. Lord Torrens
listened with some little show of interest, because
if there existed a tender spot in his heart, it was for
his daughter Patricia; but he was inwardly longing to
get back to his beloved prints.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not think you were the man to bother
yourself about women,” he said at last, jerking out the
words in his characteristic way. “If you take my
advice, as a friend, you will stick to your Parliament
and your politics; leave the women to those young
fools whose chief vocation is to become ladies’ men.
The farther you keep away from frills and furbelows,
the better for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You preach what you have not practised, Lord
Torrens,” Lionel rejoined, with a smile. “I suppose
that you were once in love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl gave an expressive gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear fellow, I was no less susceptible than the
rest; and my sweetheart—afterwards my wife, and
Patricia’s mother—was a queen amongst women.
But I sometimes wish that I had never crossed her
path; for she managed to twine herself about my
heart, became the chief delight of my life; and
then—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then?” questioned Montella, filling up the pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she died; and I was left with two infants
to bring up, and a dreary waste of years before me
to fill up as best I could. So you see that had I
never met my wife, I might have made a career of
some sort; at least, I should have been saved a
considerable amount of heartache and pain.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“And love,” added the youth, secretly wondering
that the prosaic and somewhat crusty exterior of the
Earl should conceal the heart-feelings of an emotional
being. “Is it not better to have loved and lost than
never to have loved at all? Tennyson says so. And
there is no one who will ever profit by another’s
experience in these affairs. So to return to my
question. You will approve?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you—ah—spoken to her yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a word. I could not do so until I had
obtained your consent. I—”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke off abruptly at the sound of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frou-frou</span></i>
of a woman’s skirt. The small door at the top of the
spiral staircase opened, and a girl in a simple white
dress stood on the threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I come in, father?” she asked; then noticed
the visitor. “Mr. Montella! I did not know you
were here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She advanced with outstretched hand, her face
lighting up with pleasure. The blackbirds flew down
from their perch, twittering as though in greeting.
The little turret-chamber seemed transformed by her
presence: an air of constraint crept over the two
men, and for the moment neither of them had anything
to say. The Earl returned to the tank, and
turned on the tap once more. The momentary
emotion caused by the mention of his dead wife was
now a thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very busy, my dear,” he said, somewhat
pointedly. “Very busy indeed. Perhaps you would
like to entertain Mr. Montella below? This is my
workroom, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I came up here because Mrs. Lowther has
gone to bed with a headache, and I was feeling a wee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>bit lonesome.” She smiled. “Will you come down
with me, Mr. Montella? I would like to hear what
you think of my latest attempts at verse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose with alacrity, and holding out his hand to
the Earl, turned on him a questioning glance. Lord
Torrens rewarded him with a look and gesture which
implied approval. Then he continued washing his
prints.</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella was foremost in descending the spiral
staircase, in order to assist Lady Patricia down the
final steps. Arrived at the base, they descended the
grand staircase together, and made their way to the
library, which was Lady Patricia’s favourite room.
Here she was wont to spend many a long hour in
silent communion with men and women long passed
away; for books were her counsellors and friends,
and supplied the companionship which, owing to her
father’s idiosyncrasies, she was denied. Here, too, she
wrote the lyrics and sonnets in which her poetic
instinct found its outlet. From her earliest childhood
she had possessed the happy gift of composing
verse.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went to her desk and fetched some sheets of
manuscript.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad Mrs. Lowther has gone to bed,” she
remarked, as she gave them to him. “She always
laughs at what she calls my attempts to scale
Parnassus, but I know that you won’t laugh, because
you understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The good lady has not a poetic soul,” he said, as he
ran his eye down the page. “This stanza appears to
be very promising, Lady Pat. May I take the MS.
home with me to study when  I am quiet and
undisturbed?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>She consented readily, and rolling up the sheets,
he placed them carefully in his pocket. Then, closing
the door, he began on the subject on which all his
thoughts were set. With a glad light in his eyes, and
eagerness in his voice, he told her of his love.</p>

<p class='c009'>It caused her no surprise; indeed, why should it?
She had invested Lionel Montella with a poetic
idealism almost from the first day of their acquaintance.
She admired the race from which he sprang,
and which seemed to surround him with a halo of
romance: she liked to see the verve which leapt into
his eyes when he spoke of the ancestors who had been
so cruelly wronged. More than this, she loved the
man himself; therefore his declaration seemed the
most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless there was a mist in her eyes as she
responded to his confession. She knew that he was
not a man who was easily impressed by a woman’s
personality, so that to have so greatly stirred his
heart’s emotions was to have accomplished something
indeed. She listened to his sweet nothings
with her own heart beating in response, with her face
upturned, and love’s ardour in her eyes. And so the
moments sped on—moments to be remembered in
eternity—until the chiming of a clock recalled them
to the prosaicism of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Half-past ten already,” he said, rising with
reluctance. “I have stayed an unconscionable time,
and my mother asked me particularly to come home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naughty boy!” she exclaimed playfully. “You
must put the blame on me. Does Lady Montella
know that—that—I mean, does she know about me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, dear.” His brow clouded. “But she
shall know very soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Do you think she will be displeased?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Displeased!” He took her in his arms again.
“My darling, who could be displeased where you
are concerned?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am a Christian, Lionel, and you are a Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear; but what does that matter? Are we
to be separated for life because of the difference in
our birth? The sacrifice is too great—for me, at
least. Does it make any difference to you that I
am a Jew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None at all,” she rejoined impetuously, “unless
it makes me love you more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pressed her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad—so glad—and yet—” A new thought
came into his mind. “Patricia, my heart’s dearest,
there may be dark days coming for my people. If
Athelstan Moore becomes Premier, Heaven alone
knows what new plans he may be able to carry out.
As a Member of Parliament, and a representative of
one of the oldest Jewish families in the kingdom, it is
possible I may be considered the spokesman for my
co-religionists. In that case, I shall have to defend
their cause with all the enthusiasm of which I am
capable. So you see that while I am the friend of
Christians, I must, at the same time, be the still greater
champion of the Jews. Patricia, dearest, this may
bring me into a most unenviable position, one which
I fear to ask you to share.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He let go her hands, and paced the room in
thought. The girl watched him, and a look of
determination came into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must not meet trouble half way, dear,” she
said seriously; “but whatever happens, there is
nothing that affects you in which I cannot have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>share. You must do your duty to the race to which
you belong, and I—I will help you to do it. I am
not a Jewess, Lionel, but I know that your cause is a
just one; therefore I have made up my mind to enter
into it with all my heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven for so sweet a helper!” he exclaimed
fervently. “You have taken a load off my
mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a joyous light in his eyes as he kissed
her good-bye. With her love to nerve him, he felt
able to withstand the world. At parting, she made
him promise to acquaint his parents of their engagement
without delay. She was anxious to know what
they would say when they heard that he intended to
marry a Christian girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not fear, darling,” he assured her, with
convincing ardour. “I am certain that my father, at
least, will approve of my action, and my mother’s
blessing, if it does not come at once, will soon follow
suit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His words, although intended to reassure his
sweetheart, also served as an assurance to himself.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> THE MASKED BALL</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Lionel did not feel it so easy as he had imagined
to acquaint his parents of his engagement to the
daughter of Earl Torrens. He tackled his father
first, deeming him the easier to mollify, and succeeded
in obtaining his consent to the betrothal.
To win his mother’s approval was a more difficult
matter, and one which he knew necessitated considerable
tact. He postponed the announcement
until the last possible moment, hoping that if Sir
Julian had informed her of the news, she would
herself introduce the subject; but as two days passed
without a word having been said, he was obliged to
take the initiative. His sweetheart was eagerly
awaiting the news.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella listened to her son’s confession
with compressed lips and a cloud on her brow. She
had nothing against the woman of his choice—the
Lady Patricia was well-born, and all that could be
desired in looks, manner, and disposition—but there
was one great, insuperable objection: the girl was a
Christian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are there not good and sweet Jewish girls among
your acquaintance that you must seek a wife of
another race?” she asked, with a touch of reproach.
“Could you not set your affections upon Raie
Emanuel, for instance, or Zillah Lorm?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Mother!” He glanced at her in surprise. “I
thought you would understand. Can a man just
calmly and dispassionately choose a girl first, and
<em>then</em> pour his love upon her? I admire Miss Lorm,
and I am fond of our little Raie, but I would no
more think of marrying either of them than I would
think of a journey to the moon. Don’t you see,
mother, that my feeling for Patricia is totally
different. She herself is different to all other women—whether
Jewish or Christian—that I have ever met.
Her thoughts are mine, her sympathies are mine, her
love is mine. Oh, I can’t explain it properly, but
surely you must know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an eager expression, half of entreaty, in
his face. His mother regarded him earnestly, and
realised the effort it was costing him to break through
his accustomed reserve. Her face relaxed a little of
its sternness, but the determination remained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lionel,” she asked quietly, “are you a true and
zealous Jew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.” He looked her straight in the eyes. “At
least I try to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet you would marry a Christian?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would marry the Lady Patricia; that she is a
Christian is a mere accident of birth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until now the Montella stock has been entirely
and purely Jewish. Do you think the prestige of the
family would gain by an infusion of Gentile blood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you put it that way, as long as it is ‘blue blood’
I do not think the prestige of family would suffer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella could not resist a smile, but it
quickly faded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Patricia willing to become a Jewess or, rather,
a proselyte?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The young man’s face clouded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know,” was his rejoinder. “Patricia
and I have never discussed the subject of religion,
but I believe she belongs, nominally at least, to the
Church of England. If her faith is, to her, a
source of happiness, I scarcely like to ask her to
give it up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the mother’s swift glance seemed to penetrate
his being; again the question passed her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lionel, are you a true Jew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The colour surged into his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you any reason to doubt my sincerity?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I trust not; but, my son, I am more far-seeing
than you. A Christian mother means Christian
children, a Christian household. In this way the
Montella traditions will be destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I am blessed with sons, they shall be brought
up as strict Jews.” The colour still suffused his
cheeks. “I promise you, and she shall promise too,
that the Montellas shall ever remain a Jewish family,
and faithful to their heritage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless Lady Patricia renounces her creed and
embraces ours, I shall never be satisfied. For the
sake of the future generation, and for the honour of
the House, I must insist on this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I will ask her; and I now have your
approval and consent?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Subject to this, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She sighed, and received his filial kiss with moisture
in her eyes. She felt that her boy was no longer her
own particular idol now that he had given his heart
away. Hitherto she had been the only woman to
whom he offered his sweet tokens of affection; now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>there was another—and for the moment more
attractive—goddess to whom there was homage due.
That this was in the natural course of things did not
mitigate the soreness in her heart. He was her only
and passionately beloved son.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lionel,” she said softly. “May I tell you a little
story? It is about myself. When I was a girl, long
before I met Sir Julian, I fell in love with a young
officer—a Christian. I was so much in love with him
that I thought it would break my heart to give him
up. But in spite of that I would not consent to
become his wife; there was something that held me
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Duty.” She laid an accent on the word. “My
duty to my race and faith; my duty to my parents.
I sent him away, and he eventually married a girl of
his own faith. The happiness of my married life you
know. So you see that although duty clashed with
my own inclinations at the time, it brought me the
truest happiness in the end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel paced the room with bent head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am disappointed in you, dear,” she continued
slowly. “You must not mind my telling you the
truth. I had thought that with you, as with me, duty
would occupy the foremost place. I had thought that
your enthusiasm for our race and your ambitions in
regard to the amelioration of our oppressed brethren
were such that you would forget all personal inclination.
Lionel, I am certain, as I look into the future,
that opportunity will be given you to prove your
devotion to our cause. I am certain that you are
destined to exercise a great influence, both politically
and socially, <em>as a Jew</em>. Can you wonder, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that I see in Lady Patricia a stumbling-block to your
career? Will your co-religionists have the same
opinion of you when you have married a Christian?
Will you have the same voice, the same power, when
you have married away from the race which you
profess to love so deeply? Have you considered the
question from that point of view? If not, you are
merely acting on the impulse of the moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked into his face almost appealingly, but
knew that all the arguing in the world would not
alter his determination. He was so convinced that
Patricia Byrne was his true mate, that discussion of
the pros and cons was to him beside the question.
He wished with all his heart to do his duty to his
race, and to remain faithful to his inherited religion,
and in this he believed that his sweetheart would
help, not hinder him. So the result of the interview
was as satisfactory as, under the circumstances, it
could be; on this one point it was not possible that
mother and son should think alike.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel could not make up his mind to tell his
beloved of the conditions of his mother’s approval at
once: for a short time he wished to enjoy her sweet
companionship without the smallest cloud to mar the
brightness of their love. He brought her to see his
parents, and the Earl dined with them in state, but
not a word as to their difference of religion was said
by either side. The only one who ventured to object
was Mrs. Lowther, Patricia’s companion; but as she
occupied a subordinate position, her opinion was of
little consequence. Lionel sought an interview with
her in private, and won her over in less than half an
hour. What Patricia’s relatives would have to say in
the matter, however, remained to be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The Countess of Chesterwood, at whose masked
ball Raie Emanuel intended to make her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i>, was
the widow of Earl Torrens’ nephew. An American
by birth, she possessed democratic views, modified in
accordance with the exigencies of her position in
society. She loved to surround herself with clever
people, no matter what their social status, and her
house was the resort of many a young literary
aspirant or budding musical genius. The Montellas
admired her for her shrewd common sense and
vivacious manner, and Lionel was certain that in
her he and his sweetheart would find a firm ally.
He took Patricia to call on her, but she was not at
home; and they did not see her until the night of
the ball. Her congratulations were offered in the
bright way which was one of her most charming
characteristics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you love and luck,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Luck?” repeated Patricia. “My dear Mamie,
you are thinking of the St. Leger. We don’t intend
to run a race.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Luck” was the name of Lady Chesterwood’s one
and only racer. The little widow smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Life is a race, and you need plenty of luck to
help you steer clear of the ditches,” she replied.
“However, let me satisfy your fastidious ear by
terming it ‘Providence.’ Mr. Montella, you haven’t
asked me for a dance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel apologised, and took possession of her card.
Then he glanced at her costume.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are an Italian lady?” he queried, in doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Dante’s <em>Beatrice</em>; rather an assumption,
isn’t it! But I am <em>so</em> tired of the conventional
fancy-dress people. Besides, my mask will conceal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>my face until midnight. What made you two choose
to represent the Stuarts?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A lack of originality on my part, I think,”
Patricia replied. “The ‘bonnie prince’ is one of
my pet heroes, so I suggested him for Lionel, and
Mary Queen of Scots seemed to follow suit. By the
way, Mamie, what sort of people have you here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All sorts and conditions. Authors, actors,
musicians, artists, a sprinkling of politicians, and
many mere society people. They are all thoroughly
respectable, I assure you, my dear, and as you won’t
be introduced, it doesn’t matter if you should happen
to dance with someone of whom, ordinarily, your
chaperon would not approve. Here, Equality is the
watchword. In the matter of this masked ball, at
least, I am a law unto myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bowed and swept away on the arm of a
chivalrous knight. The musicians struck up the
spirited tune of a new dance which had recently
been invented, and the lovers, preferring to witness
it rather than to take part, mounted to the gallery in
order to view the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</span></i>. The ball-room was
decorated in white and gold, the clusters of electric
light arranged to form huge daffodils hanging at
measured intervals from the painted ceiling. The
musicians were almost hidden by a bank of flowers,
consisting principally of orchids and the rarest ferns;
a similar bank adorned the other end of the room.
The motley dresses of the guests—some attractive,
some merely grotesque—lent a brilliancy which was
somewhat bizarre in its effect. To the onlookers, the
combination of personalities was curious—perhaps
not without significance to some who were there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is Oliver Cromwell dancing with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>charming little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivandière</span></i>,” observed Patrica, with
amusement. “What must the shade of that worthy
Puritan think—if think it can?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us hope that in the course of centuries it has
gained sense,” Lionel responded lightly. “Do you
not recognise the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivandière</span></i>? It is our Raie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Emanuel? How <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</span></i> she looks; and the
Cromwell, who is he, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no idea; but we had better avoid him,
hadn’t we? Cromwell was rather antagonistic
towards the Stuarts, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed. “All the more reason why we
should attempt a reconciliation now. Don’t be
surprised if you see me as his partner a little later
on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lovers were obliged to separate when the music
came to a close, for both were engaged elsewhere.
Patricia was taken back to Mrs. Lowther, and Lionel
went off to find “Cleopatra,” otherwise Zillah Lorm.
He saw his sweetheart, a few minutes later, dancing
with a courtier of the period of Louis XIV., and could
not help remarking how sweet she looked. Miss
Lorm’s eyes gleamed through the eyelets of her
mask as she made a response; she was not one of
those who care to hear any individual of their own
sex praised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must congratulate you on your engagement,
Mr. Lionel,” she said, with a slight effort. “I was
somewhat surprised when Lady Montella informed
me of the news. I did not think that you—of all
people—would marry without the pale; but, of course,
there is no Earl’s daughter to be found among the
Jews.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter part of her speech was spoken jestingly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>but the sting was no less keen. The young man’s
face coloured beneath his mask. Had anyone else
proffered such a remark, he could only have received
it as an insult. Restraining the hasty rejoinder which
rose to his lips, he kept silence, and Zillah, seeing that
her dart had struck home, immediately changed the
subject. But the pleasure of the evening was spoilt
for Montella, and a troubled expression settled on
his brow. It occurred to him that the singer had
perhaps unconsciously foretold the decision of public
opinion—namely, that he was marrying the Lady
Patricia Byrne on account of her noble birth, and in
order to strengthen his position as a member of the
aristocracy. He knew that public opinion was never
inclined to ascribe a man’s action to lofty and disinterested
motives, but in this case it would vex him
greatly if he were misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mind was busy all the time he danced, and
Zillah Lorm might have been miles away, so little
was he influenced by her charms. The room was
crowded, for it was close on midnight, when the culminating
point of the evening would be reached. It
needed some amount of care on the part of the men
to lead their partners gracefully through the maze of
dancers, and two or three times Zillah narrowly
escaped colliding with the others. Montella—probably
because his thoughts were elsewhere—was
unusually awkward, and just as he was guiding his
partner round a difficult corner, he accidentally trod
upon a lady’s dress. There followed the sound of
tearing lace and splitting seams, and an exclamation
of anger escaped from the lady at having been
stopped short in that unpleasant way. Her partner—the
Oliver Cromwell whom Patricia had noticed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>earlier in the evening—insisted that the offender had
been guilty of gross carelessness, and waiving the
young man’s apologies, proceeded to harangue him
on the subject. There was something so aggressive
in his manner that Montella felt his temper rise, and
gave vent to a heated rejoinder, quite foreign to his
general equability. The “Cromwell” took it up,
determined to give his pugnacious propensities full
sway, whilst the ladies stood by and listened
uncomfortably to the wordy war.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have ruined the lady’s dress, and spoilt her
evening,” he said, glaring at the culprit as if he were
a schoolboy. “And all you do in return is to stand
there and make lame apologies. I should think the
least you could do would be to make amends like a
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. What can I do? If this lady will
kindly tell me, I shall be happy to do it. I have
already expressed my deep regret that the accident
should have occurred.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lady gathered her train over her arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I accept the apology of ‘King Charles,’” she said,
her vexation already subdued. “It is not worth
while quarrelling about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The clock struck twelve as she spoke, and as the
last chime died away, the order was given to unmask.
The two men fronted each other, and simultaneously
uncovered their faces. Montella almost involuntarily
gave a start, for the countenance of his opponent
was curiously and unpleasantly familiar. He had
seen it pictured in all the illustrated journals in the
kingdom, cartooned in <cite>Punch</cite>, caricatured elsewhere;
he had seen it scowling at the Opposition in the
House, and at the anxious journalists in the Lobby.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>It was most unfortunate that this regrettable circumstance
should be connected with his first personal
introduction to the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment’s silence, during which the
young politician’s eyes fell like an abashed schoolboy.
The “Cromwell” was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your name?” he demanded curtly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Selim Montella.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Montella? member for Thorpe Burstall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Mine is—as you may know—Athelstan
Moore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He offered his arm to his partner, and without
another word, turned shortly away. Zillah Lorm
looked after them with increasing interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The new Premier!” she exclaimed, as soon as
they were out of earshot. “Athelstan Moore, the
Jew-hater! Was it wise to offend him, Mr. Lionel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wise? It was the most foolish thing I ever did
in my life,” he rejoined, with a short laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was amusing—to the singer—to witness his
discomfiture.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> THE STORY OF FERDINAND</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Acting on his mother’s advice, Lionel Montella
wrote a letter of apology to the Premier, and received
a short note of acknowledgment in return. It was
some time before he could overcome his vexation
at the unfortunate encounter, even though he was
assured by his confrères that the destiny of a nation
is not affected by petty personal spite. He knew
that it was good policy on his part to conciliate the
chief Minister of State, instead of which he had done
the direct opposite by personally offending him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new Premier’s attitude towards the Jewish
community soon made itself felt. The greater part
of the press—the part which was open to bribery
and corruption—was in his favour, and did not
hesitate to voice his opinions and echo his
antagonism. About this time a celebrated Consolidated
Trust, of which the principal directors were
South African Jews, went to destruction, making one
of the most sensational failures on record. Hundreds
of people were ruined, but the directors managed to
emerge unharmed, and the rumours of swindling on
their part were left unrefuted. Immediately the
papers expressed their sympathy for the unfortunate
Gentile victims who had been preyed upon by
swindling Jews, and long leaders declared that such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>things should not be. Following the rule in such
cases, the whole Hebrew community was made to
suffer for the reprehensible actions of the few. Public
feeling—always ready to rush to extremes—ranged
itself conclusively on the side of the anti-Semites;
and the man in the street, as well as the music-hall
artiste, kept his sneer ready for the unfortunate Jew.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this did not affect the Montellas so keenly as
those who were more in touch with the masses. They
read the papers, and inwardly burned with indignation,
but from the taunts which greeted the ears of their
poorer brethren they were happily exempt. Lionel
went out and about, never seeking to conceal his
origin from those who despised his race; but there
was something in the influence of his personality
which forbade any remark of disparagement to fall in
his hearing. Raie Emanuel was the only member of
the household who was to some extent personally
concerned. She went to see her relations in Canonbury,
and found them smarting under what they
considered a cruel rebuff. Their only son—a smart
youth of nineteen—had been dismissed from the
office in which he had hoped to obtain promotion,
and the two little girls had been expelled from their
ladies’ school.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Expelled!” Raie exclaimed, in dismay. “But
why? what have they done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer her mother handed her the note she
had received from the principal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all,” was her reply.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>“Miss Perkins regrets that owing to the wishes
of some of the parents of her scholars she is obliged
to ask Mrs. Emanuel to remove her two daughters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Pearl and Charlotte, from the school. Miss
Perkins ventures to respectfully suggest that the
girls would be happier if educated at a Hebrew
school, or by a Hebrew governess at home.”</em></p>

<p class='c009'>Raie tossed the note impatiently aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish people wouldn’t call us ‘Hebrews,’” she
said. “It irritates me. Well, I suppose Pearl and
Lottie will be able to exist without the advantages
obtained at Miss Perkins’ seminary. But how absurd
it all is. As if Pearl and Lottie were the least bit
different to the Smiths, Jones, and Robinson girls!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I’m no different to the other chaps at the
office,” Walter added, in an aggrieved tone; “but just
because old Blank has taken a dislike to the name of
Jew, I’ve got the sack. I wish I’d never been born a
Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you must not say that,” Raie said reprovingly.
“It is a great privilege to be a Jew, and if Christians
believed what they preach, they would give us the
honour which is our due.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This little speech was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Lady Montella, whose
views the girl unconsciously imbibed. The Emanuels
regarded Raie as the oracle of the family, and looked
up to her as living on a higher plane than themselves.
Mrs. Emanuel was a widow, with six children and a
small income. It had been no easy matter to rear
and educate these children, even though the eldest
had been taken off her hands at the age of fourteen.
The second girl, Harriet, had just become engaged to
the son of a wealthy stockbroker, which was a matter
for congratulation to the Emanuels and their relatives.
Harriet was a bright girl of seventeen, with what her
mother called a “taking” manner. She contributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to the family purse by teaching music at a kindergarten
school, and was out when Raie arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve been looking at houses all the week,” Mrs.
Emanuel said, when the girl inquired after her sister.
“The sooner they get settled the better. I don’t
believe in long engagements; never did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie considered a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if Harriet will be happy with Harry
Levi,” she said thoughtfully. “He is not a man I
could care for in the least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You never did like him,” her mother remarked;
“but then you’ve not got to marry him, so it doesn’t
matter. He seems affable enough, I think. Have
you any reason for your dislike?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only that the Montellas do not approve of his
family. Harry Levi’s father waxed fat over the
Consolidated Trust concern, and Lionel says that
Harry himself is not over-scrupulous. Lionel Montella
would not say a thing like that unless there
were good reason.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Emanuel regarded her contemplatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You seem to think a great deal of Lionel
Montella,” she rejoined. “You always talk about him
as if he were a prophet or a prince. I shall not be
at all surprised when I hear that he has fallen in love
with you and asked you to marry him. Well, it
would be a great <em>simcha</em><a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> for us, I am sure. The
<cite>Jewish Chronicle</cite> would give you a notice—‘<em>A
marriage has been arranged between Mr. Lionel
Selim Montella, M.P., only son of Sir Julian and
Lady Selim Montella, and Miss Raie Emanuel,
eldest daughter of Mrs. Joshua Emanuel, late of
Liverpool.</em>’ Wouldn’t it make the Canonbury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>people sit up, eh? Instead of Mrs. Abrahams
snubbing me like she does, she would come and
implore me to attend her next dinner-party; and I
would say—‘So sorry: I’ve promised to dine with
dear Lady Montella.’”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Joy.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Raie put up her hand, as though to stay her
mother’s garrulity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma!” she exclaimed, her cheeks tingling,
“I wish you would not talk like that. It’s so vul—so
horrid. I would not marry Lionel Montella, even if
he asked me, because I do not consider myself fitted
to become his wife. As he will not ask me, however,
I shall be saved the trouble of declining. Have you
not heard that he is engaged to Lady Patricia
Byrne?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” Mrs. Emanuel sat bolt upright. “This
is news, indeed. Who is Lady Patricia What’s-her-name?
A Jewess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; a—Christian—the daughter of Earl Torrens—gloriously
beautiful, and with a face like a Greuze.
She is far more suitable as a wife for Mr. Montella
than a plain, insignificant little creature like myself
could ever be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was nothing either of mock modesty or
bitterness in her words. She knew that she was
small and slight, with ordinary features and ordinary
abilities. She did not know that when she spoke
her eyes sparkled with animation, and that the
sweetness of her smile amply compensated for the
irregularity of her features. She did not know either
that there was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> about her manner which
endeared her to those with whom she came into
contact. Perhaps, had she known, the charm would
no longer have been there.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Lionel Montella has no right to marry a <em>shicksa</em>,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
even if she does belong to the aristocracy,” was Mrs.
Emanuel’s stricture. “If you are not good enough
for him, why doesn’t he marry a Rothschild? It
must be a terrible disappointment to his father,
especially after the trouble he has had with
Ferdinand.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Gentile.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Who is Ferdinand?” asked Raie, her cheeks still
burning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdinand Montella, of course. Sir Julian’s son
by his first wife, who was a Miss Klonsberg of
Birkenhead, and second cousin of your poor papa’s
step-brother’s wife. Do you mean to say, child, that
you’ve lived with the Montellas all this time without
ever hearing of Ferdinand, or that I never told you
about him? It seems almost incredible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie became interested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have never heard the name until you mentioned
it just now,” she replied. “Tell me all about him,
please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Emanuel was fond of relating the personal
history of anyone with whom she happened to be
acquainted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdinand is the skeleton in the Montellas’ cupboard,”
she began, giving her daughter time to digest
the statement. “His mother died when he was born,
and until his father married again he was brought up
by a relation of the Selim Montellas. He was
expelled from Eton, and ran away from boarding-school,
and was the sort of little monster who would
never be able to abstain from wickedness outside a
reformatory. When he was about eighteen, he did
something shady—I don’t quite know what it was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>for the matter was hushed up, but I believe he tried
to embezzle, or something of the sort. Anyway, Sir
Julian disinherited him, cut him out of his will, and
sent him off to Australia with just enough money to
pay his passage. Since then, the name of Ferdinand
has been tabooed by the Montella family, which, I
suppose, accounts for your ignorance of the matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie’s eyes were wide open.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do they never hear from him?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know; but I heard that Sir Julian once
received a letter from him, and returned it unopened.
You ought to know whether they receive letters from
Australia or not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never trouble myself about the Montellas’
correspondence; they receive letters from all kinds
of places. Besides, Ferdinand may have left
Australia. How long ago did it all happen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Emanuel thought a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me see,” she replied musingly. “It was just
after Pearl was born. I remember quite well, because
Lady Montella paid me a visit, and I was wearing a
pale-blue dressing-gown trimmed with Irish lace. It
was the first day I sat up in my room. It must be
about eleven years ago. Ferdinand—if he is still
alive—will be about thirty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So old?” To Raie thirty seemed like middle age.
“What a strange story; it quite fascinates me,
and”—there was a touch of excitement in her voice—“why,
if there is an elder son, Lionel will not
succeed to the title and estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the estates, yes; to the title, no. Sir Julian
cannot will away the baronetcy, much as he might
like to do so. Lionel will never be a baronet unless
his step-brother dies.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Poor Lal! But I do not think he has much
craving for a title; he is not that kind of man. I
wonder why Lady Montella has never mentioned her
step-son to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The matter gave her food for speculation during
the remainder of the day. It seemed so strange that
Sir Julian—the mild, unobtrusive Sir Julian—should
go to such lengths as to disinherit his own son. The
more she thought about the scapegrace the more
her heart went out to him, although she knew that
her sympathy was probably undeserved. When she
returned to the flat she routed out an old family
album, and carefully turned over the leaves. There
were photographs in abundance of Lady Montella in
different positions and dresses, chiefly dating from
her early wedded days. There were photographs of
Lionel in the various periods of infancy, as well as of
the two little children who had died. Raie was
deeply interested in them all, but she glanced at
them cursorily in her eagerness to find the one she
sought. At last her attention was arrested by a
carte-de-visite in platinotype of a youth in a golf
blazer, club in hand. It had evidently been taken
some years ago, and was partially discoloured. The
face of the young man was somewhat sensual in
character, the mouth weak, but the eyes, on the
contrary denoted intellect, and were so like Sir
Julian’s that Raie looked at them in doubt. Flicking
the dust from the album, she carried it into the study,
where Lionel was writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lal,” she demanded, as he put down his pen, “is
this your father when he was a young man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella glanced at the photograph, then up at
the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where have you been rummaging, Raie?” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>remarked, with curiosity. “This photograph is not
my father, but a lad who went abroad a long time
ago. I am afraid I must not tell you his name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Ferdinand Montella,” she returned boldly.
“You see I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He regarded her with surprise. “Who told you?”
he asked, in his quiet way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guessed it; but mamma was talking to me
about Ferdinand to-day. I did not know there was
such a person in existence. There seems to be quite a
mystery about him. May I not know what it is, Lal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You surely do not desire to know what my
parents wish to keep secret, do you, Raie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no—if you put it like that; but I did not
think there was any harm in asking. Perhaps Aunt
Inez will not mind telling me now that I am no
longer a child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should advise you not to mention the subject
for the present, Raie,” he answered seriously. “It
isn’t worth while raking up a story of the past which
people would rather forget, is it? Perhaps, if you
wait a little while, my mother will tell you of her
own accord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie quenched her thirst for information, and
acquiesced, but still regarded the pictured face
intently. There was an expression in the eyes
which took her fancy; and in spite of the weakness
of the mouth, the lips indicated good-humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like Ferdinand Montella,” she said decidedly,
with a secret wonder at her own effusiveness. “He
may not be perfect, and I suppose, from what mamma
says, he is something of a scapegrace; but he has
rather a nice face, I think. If ever he comes back I
shall stand up for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was such an impetuous child.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> A HOUSE OF MOURNING</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sir Julian was very ill. His physician had to be
rung up in the middle of the night, and arrived to
find him in an exceedingly critical condition. Raie,
tucked up in her little white bed, awoke with a start
to hear footsteps in the corridor, and the subdued
sound of voices. Hastily attiring herself in her
dressing-gown, she unlocked her door and peered out
to see what was happening. As she did so, the bald
head and gaunt figure of the physician emerged from
the morning-room, followed by Lady Montella in
deshabille. Raie, not wishing to be noticed, shrank
back into her own room; but a few minutes later she
put her head out again, and espied a maid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maggie!” she called, in a whisper. “Mr. Lionel
isn’t ill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it’s Sir Julian; had another stroke. They
think it’s the end. Mr. Lionel has gone for the
rabbi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” There was a scared look on her face.
She called the girl into her room, and shut the door.
“It’s frightfully sudden,” she remarked, sinking on
to a little wicker chair. “He was normal when
Lady Montella went to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, miss, it came on all of a sudden like. Those
things always do. I remember my grandfather whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>we buried a year come Christmas; he had St. Vitus’s
dance—the twitchings, you know, and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tell me,” interrupted the girl, with a
shudder. “I’ve got the creeps already. Tell me,
Maggie, do you think I ought to go into Sir Julian’s
room when the minister comes? I don’t want to go,
because I feel so horribly nervous, and I’ve never
been near anyone who is dying before, but if—if
Lady Montella expects it—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should go back to bed if I were you, miss,” the
servant advised. “There is no occasion for you to
go near a death-bed unless you are obliged. You
will not do Sir Julian nor my lady any good by
upsetting yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I don’t want auntie to think me unkind.
Will you ask her, please, Maggie? Tell her I send
my love, and am very sorry; and if she wants me,
I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The maid rose with an air of reluctance and took
the message. Two minutes later she returned. Her
ladyship sent her love, and wished her niece to go to
sleep without frightening herself. Everything that
was possible was being done for the patient,
therefore her presence could not assist.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie jumped back into bed and snuggled down,
with a sigh of relief; but sleep was impossible. She
was on the alert for every sound, and heard the
coming of the minister with a flutter of excitement at
her heart. The atmosphere seemed to be charged
with a sense of death, and the silence seemed more
acute because occasionally broken by subdued snatches
of conversation. She buried her head beneath the
counterpane, as though in fear of beholding the King
of Terrors in visible form. She recollected all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>gruesome stories she had heard of death and the
dying, and did her best to induce a nightmare. She
imagined she felt the passing of Sir Julian’s soul, and
a tremor ran through her being at the thought.
Wondering if all were over, she heard the physician
take his departure. It seemed as if morning would
never come, for long hours passed without bringing
light. Eventually, however, she awoke out of a short
and troubled sleep to hear the yodel of the early
milkman. The long night was over at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>At breakfast-time she entered the morning-room,
scarcely knowing how to frame the question which
rose to her lips. Lionel Montella was reclining in
the easy-chair with his eyes closed; no doubt he was
tired after his sleepless night. He opened his eyes at
her approach, and glanced at her wearily. Then he
gave her the usual matutinal greeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look worn out,” she observed sympathetically.
“If I were you I should go and rest until lunch-time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father is dying,” he rejoined, in a low voice.
“Did you not know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.” She did not tell him that she had made
up her mind that Sir Julian was already dead. “I
am so sorry, Lionel. You must feel upset, and poor
auntie, too. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the sick-room; she will not leave his side. I
have begged her to take some rest, but she is
determined to stay with him until a change occurs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They sat down at the table, but neither of them
could eat. Lionel left his omelette untasted, and his
letters unread; and Raie forbore to glance through
the newspaper, as was her daily custom. After
breakfast, she screwed up her courage and knocked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>at the door of Sir Julian’s room. She had made up
her mind that it was her duty to visit the old man; in
the daytime the ordeal did not seem so great.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was awake, and droning Hebrew prayers in an
inaudible voice in company with the minister. Lady
Montella sat by the bedside, her beautiful face drawn
and anxious. Raie went over to her and kissed her
without a word; she did not know quite what to say.
She was a sensitive girl, and often restrained herself
from mere shyness; but Lady Montella knew her
well, and understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Sir Julian made as if he would sit up.
“Ferdinand!” he exclaimed, and then again,
“Ferdinand!” He had not mentioned the name for
ten years. Lady Montella rose from her seat with
a start; Raie remained inert, but the name attracted
her attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sick man gazed at them as if he were dazed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdinand,” he repeated; “I thought he was
here. I don’t want to see him.” His words came
with difficulty. “Send him away. Tell him he has
brought down my grey hairs with sorrow to the
grave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella bent over the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdinand is not here,” she repeated, in a low
voice. “We do not know where he is; but if we
can find him, will you not forgive him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. He shall not have a penny.” His words
grew fainter. “He is no more my son. He sold—his—birthright—for—a
mess of pottage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie listened with all her ears, but the dying man
did not speak again, and soon fell into the lethargy
which preceded the end. The physician came again,
but the baronet was beyond the reach of human aid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>At two o’clock in the afternoon Lady Montella was
led out of the room, half-fainting. Sir Julian was
dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie had never been in a house of death before,
for her father had been drowned at sea. She
was too shy to go in to her foster-aunt at once, and
wandered in and out of the darkened reception rooms
as if she were unable to rest. The household was in
a state of confusion, for it was Friday, and therefore
necessary that the preliminary burial rites should be
performed before the Sabbath fell. She heard Lionel
and the minister arrange the details, and afterwards
she saw the repulsive-looking <em>wachers</em><a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> who had
come to stay with the body until Sunday, when the
funeral would take place. There were people coming
and going all the afternoon, and she was obliged to
have her tea in solitude. After it was over she was
sent for to Lady Montella’s boudoir.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Professional watchers by the dead.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She obeyed the summons without delay, and clung
to her foster-aunt with the tears welling up in her
eyes. When the first outburst of emotion was over,
Lady Montella asked her if she would like to go
home until after the funeral; it would be so very
dull for her in the house of mourning. Raie
conquered her first impulse and decided to remain.
She did not feel justified in leaving Lady Montella
alone in her sorrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was indeed a dull week. In accordance with
Jewish usage all the blinds in the flat were kept
down for seven days instead of being pulled up
directly after the funeral. The principal mourners,
including two of Sir Julian’s sisters, sat on low chairs
to lament and receive the condolences of their friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>whilst near by a tiny float burned in a glass of oil
as a memorial of the dead. Every evening a service
was held in the drawing-room, attended by most
of the Jewish gentlemen of the Montellas’ acquaintance,
and not a few strangers. It was Lionel’s
melancholy duty to say <em>Kaddish</em> for his father,
which prayer he would have to repeat daily until
his term of mourning expired.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the first visitors to offer her condolence
was Lady Patricia Byrne. Accompanied by Mrs.
Lowther, she drove up in a closed carriage, bringing
a beautiful wreath composed of lilies and violets. As
no flowers were permitted to decorate the coffin, however,
the wreath was placed in the room where the
<em>shiva</em><a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> was held. It was the first opportunity Lady
Montella’s relatives and friends had of observing
Lionel’s future wife, and they did not scruple to make
the most of it. Attired in complimentary mourning,
with a black picture hat to set off the fairness of her
hair and complexion, and carrying herself with an
unaffected but distinguished air of grace, the girl
certainly satisfied their critical eyes. With her face
lit up with honest sympathy, she conversed with the
mourners in a way which proved her tact and her
knowledge of Jewish customs. Lionel’s face glowed
with pride and gratification at the presence of his
beloved.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Lowther was a colonel’s widow, fair, fat, and
forty. She was devoted to her charge, but she did
not understand the girl in the least. She was much
too prosaic and matter-of-fact to enter into the
hidden depths of Patricia’s temperament; and
although she had lived with her for years, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>knew only her exterior. Her manner towards Lionel
Montella’s relatives was decidedly distant, and sitting
apart, she did not attempt to join in the conversation.
She showed unmistakably that she had come merely
for Patricia’s sake, and not for her own. Her face
expressed disapproval as they re-entered the carriage
and were driven homewards.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are the most curious girl I ever came across,
Pat,” she said, with a sigh. “I wonder what your
poor mother would have thought of you had she
lived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À propos</span></i> of what?” interrogated Patricia, with
wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, your foolish engagement to this young man,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia’s brow contracted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you liked him,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I’ve nothing against him personally, but I
do not approve of your becoming connected with a
Jewish family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not going to marry the family,” the girl
corrected amiably. “I have no desire to have more
than one husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her chaperon frowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought not to joke on this subject, Patricia,”
she rejoined. “Your words confirm my opinion:
you do not realise the gravity of the step you intend
to take.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do—to its fullest extent. That is why I
have allowed Mr. Montella to give me an engagement
ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean to say that you really have anything
in common with those people—the people we
have just left?” Mrs. Lowther asked, still unconvinced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Cannot you see that they live in a world of their
own, cemented by their religious and national customs?
You may attempt to enter that world, but you must
for ever remain an outsider. Even if you marry a
Jew, you are not, and never can be, a Jewess. There
is no strain of Oriental blood in you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not be so sure. I believe if I choose to look
up the family tree I shall be able to discover some
remote Hebrew ancestor. But that is nothing.
Lionel is quite as British as I am. The Torrens
were originally French.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall you do?” pursued her chaperon,
unwilling to leave the subject. “Become a Jewish
proselyte, or turn Mr. Montella into a Christian?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not see the necessity for either,” Patricia
rejoined, with a slight flush; “but one thing is
certain. Situated as he is, Lionel cannot possibly
forsake the faith of his forefathers. Were he to do
so, the whole fabric of his Jewish inheritance would
be shattered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I suppose that if you were to find it
necessary, you would become a pervert rather than
he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot answer that at the moment. But why
discuss the matter until we are obliged to consider
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should we shirk it simply because it is
disagreeable? It is one that will have to be faced
as soon as you take any definite steps towards
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl leant back against the cushions with an
expression of weariness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall not be married until Mr. Montella’s
year of mourning is at an end, so I shall not have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>to decide hastily,” she answered. “I shall do what
appears to me to be the best. Religion is not meant
to separate man and wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Lowther sighed. “What a pity you have an
Agnostic for a father,” she said.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> THE UNEMPLOYED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Lowther’s remark was not without foundation.
The Earl, despite the fact that he was patron of more
than one living in the country, had severed his connection
with the Established Church some years ago,
and now professed no religion, save that of Agnosticism.
His son—a youth at Sandhurst—followed in his
wake, talked grandiosely of the First Cause, and
pinned his faith on Huxley. Patricia saved the
reputation of the family—in the eyes of her father’s
tenants, at least—by attending the Parish Church
regularly when she was in the country; but as
Patricia’s religion had never been properly moulded,
it was liable to variation. Her first finishing governess
being a Roman Catholic, her youthful mind had
been filled with the mystic saint-lore of the Roman
Church, and she fell deeply in love with St. Patrick,
her patron saint. As Patricia had always been deeply
in love with somebody or other since the days
of her swaddling clothes, however, her father was
not greatly concerned, and expressed no surprise
when she told him one morning that she
found Mariolatry and Saintolatry detestable, and
asked to have the Roman Catholic governess sent
away. Good St. Patrick was dislodged from the
little niche she had accorded him, his image was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>shattered into a hundred pieces, and Patricia was
heart-whole once more. The next phase through
which she passed was that of admiration for Comte
and Swedenborg, but as the ethics of both were
beyond her comprehension, she was little influenced
by either. From Positivism she found her way into
Unitarianism, and with her usual craving for some
great teacher whom she delighted to honour, she
made Ralph Waldo Emerson—or rather his writings—her
oracle. It was somewhat curious that Patricia’s
religion always concentrated itself around some <em>person</em>,
yet she did not seek to render her homage to a
personal God. Her only experience of Christianity
other than Romanism was the stern Evangelicism of
her old nurse, and this creed, with its narrow interpretations
and material heaven, she found equally as
repellent as the former. Although not lacking in
spiritual perception, she had not yet rightly understood
the divine personality of the Incarnate Deity;
she admired Christ, it is true, but in the same way
she admired Gautama—the founder of Buddhism—and
Confucius. To her, the heaven of the Christian
and the Nirvana of the Buddhist were almost
synonymous terms; and the gospel of right living
the only one that was necessary. So that when her
lover suggested with much diffidence that she should
become a member of his own faith, she did not meet
his proposal with the firm refusal he had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were sitting under the trees in one of the
quietest spots in Kensington Gardens, glad to escape
for the moment from the din and roar of the traffic.
Although late autumn, the air was mild and dry, and
Patricia allowed her sables to fall from her shoulders
and to rest on the back of the chair. She listened to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>her lover’s words with animation in her face, and
wonder in her eyes; she could not make an
immediate reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The idea is so curious, so difficult to grasp,” she
said, when he had finished. “Judaism seems so
formidable to the uninitiated. I am afraid I should
break the laws a hundred times a day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think you would. Judaism does not
demand so much from a woman as from a man. All
a Jewess has to do is to see that her mènage is
ordered in accordance with Jewish law, and to bring
up her children in the Jewish faith. More will not
be expected of you than that; and as we can have a
Jewish housekeeper, you need not be worried with
the details of the dietary and other laws.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what of my own personal religion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As long as you keep to Theism—the absolute
Unity—you can believe what you please,” Montella
replied. “So you see your Judaism need not be so
difficult after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia’s eyes waxed thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must give me a few days to think it over,”
she said, after a short pause. “You are not in a hurry,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. I promised the mater I would ask
you. She is such an enthusiastic Jewess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I admire her for it. It is a wonder she
does not live in the Holy Land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really believe she would, if Palestine were a
Jewish country,” he replied. “She cherishes a grudge
against the Sultan for shilly-shallying over the affair
all these years. She is, like myself, an ardent Zionist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They rose from their chairs, and made their way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>towards the Albert Gate. Patricia was unusually
vivacious, and giving a truce to serious subjects,
chatted in lighter vein. When they reached the
main road, however, they were abruptly silenced.
The smile faded from the young Member’s face, and
the girl looked on with equal gravity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The traffic was being stopped by a procession—a
procession characterised by sordidness, for those who
took part constituted the great body of the unemployed
in the metropolis. Four abreast they walked, dirty,
unkempt men, with ragged clothes and emaciated
faces. They had turned out in hundreds, organised
presumably by a trade-union, in order to enlist the
sympathy of a good-natured public. Here and there
banners were displayed, bearing the legend:—“<em>Unemployed
and starving</em>”; “<em>British workmen
thrown out by aliens</em>”; “<em>Employ British labour</em>”;
“<em>Boycott alien labour</em>”; “<em>Boycott foreign Jews</em>,”
and other numerous inscriptions. Along the route,
which was guarded by the police, men were collecting
money from the passers-by. It was indeed a sight to
move the most phlegmatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia almost involuntarily tightened her grasp on
her lover’s arm. A more depraved-looking set of human
beings she had never seen. Some, it is true, were
stalwart Britons, or had been before the starvation
process had set in; but the majority of them were
unable to hold themselves erect from sheer weakness,
and the dogged expression of misery was on all faces
alike. The expression haunted the girl for weeks;
it suggested to her naught else but the faces of lost
spirits in Hades. She turned away with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Terrible!” she exclaimed unsteadily. “It makes
me feel quite ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Do not look, dear,” Montella advised, with
solicitude. “Such sights are not for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I must look.” She turned back again.
“One cannot shirk such a grim reality. I knew that
while we were living in luxury there existed thousands
who had not the bare necessities of life, but I have
never had the fact pressed home so forcibly before.
I feel as if I had no right to wear these expensive
sables—which I could so easily do without—when
these poor creatures have nothing to eat. The look
in their eyes condemns me. Cannot we do something
to help them, Lionel? Surely there must be something
terribly wrong somewhere, or else we should
never see such a degrading sight as this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She unfastened the magnificent diamond brooch
she wore beneath her jacket, and impulsively cast it
into the collecting-box; her tiny gold purse with its
contents followed suit. Her lover, even if he thought
her proceeding rash, did not remonstrate; he too
divested himself of all the gold in his possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The condition of these people is not exactly the
fault of the Government,” he replied thoughtfully, as
they moved on towards Knightsbridge. “It is always
disastrous to trade when the supply exceeds the
demand. It makes labour so cheap that the men
cannot ask more than a starvation wage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what is the reason?” she asked, with eagerness.
“It seems almost incredible that all these
hundreds should be thrown out of employment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you not noticed the banners?” he returned.
“‘Alien labour’—that is at the root of their distress.
It is hateful to me to have to acknowledge it—nevertheless
the fact remains that the influx of
pauper Jews from the Continent has been enormous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>during the past few years. Athelstan Moore once
introduced a Bill in Parliament for the suppression
of alien immigration; but there was some flaw in it,
and it was thrown out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you vote for or against?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Against. You see, whatever my private opinion
may be, I am tied down in this matter. I cannot
vote against my own people, especially when I am
told that owing to the persecution abroad they come
here to try and regain their self-respect, and to
develop into worthy British subjects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is your private opinion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That when they do develop into worthy British
subjects, the result is satisfactory, but when they
persist in being clannish and in refusing to conform
to the exigencies of modern civilisation, they are a
clog on the wheel of national progress. I do not
consider it politic on the part of our country to
continue to receive them in such great numbers.
The consequence you have just seen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia was silent for a moment, but she was not
yet satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do the employers prefer to engage foreigners
to work for them?” she asked, after a short pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because the pauper aliens require less wages.
They are so anxious to get work of some kind that
they will accept the lowest wage possible; and they
can live on next to nothing. Then when they have
learnt their respective trades, they become sweaters
on their own account. The whole system is most
deplorable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the legitimate British workman goes to the
wall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“It is a great shame.” Her eyes flashed with
indignation. “And yet where would the poor Jews
go if they are expelled from the Continent and we
forbid them to come here? They must go somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, that is the great question.” He sighed. “If
America closes her doors to them as South Africa
has done, there seems to be only Australia left, and
in Australia their company will be as little desired
as it is here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It reminds me of the Wandering Jew—the one
who insulted the Christ when He was on the way
to His crucifixion, and was condemned to live and
wander through the ages until the Day of Judgment,”
the girl said musingly. “Only in this case the
wandering Jew has been multiplied into a whole
horde of wandering Jews. Do you think there is
any truth in the legend, Lionel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her lover smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know, dear,” he replied. “I dare say it
is the same as other legends—a tenth part of truth,
and nine-tenths superstition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but it is a very fascinating legend. Do you
know, Lionel, the condition of the Jews in modern
days has always been to me one of the strongest
arguments in favour of Christianity. It is such an
exact fulfilment of prophecy. I wonder if they will
ever fulfil the other part of the prophecy and
eventually make Palestine their home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the Zionists have anything to do with it they
will; but it is scarcely likely to happen in our time.
What an interest you take in Jewish affairs, Patricia!
You might be a Jewess yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl smiled, knowing that her interest was
only on her lover’s account, and that had he not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>a Jew, that interest would never have been aroused.
Truth to tell, Mrs. Lowther and Lady Chesterwood
were frightfully bored by what they termed Patricia’s
Jewish hobby. The Countess had forbidden the
subject to be mentioned in her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was there waiting for them when they arrived
at Earl Torrens’ mansion, and received them with a
sigh of relief. Ten minutes of the Earl’s society was
to her an amplitude, and she had listened to his
dissertation on the triumph of colour photography
for twenty minutes by the clock. Perhaps the Earl
was equally glad to be released from his arduous
duty; for he retired as soon as the lovers made their
appearance. Lionel, having an appointment elsewhere
was obliged to take his departure; so, promising
to look in again later, he left the ladies to themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Lowther is out,” Patricia remarked, as she
took off her things, and rang for her maid. “Will
you stay to lunch?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to very much. I made up my mind
to do so directly your respected father informed me
that the she-dragon was off duty. I really cannot
understand how you can tolerate her, Pat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Lowther? Oh, she is a well-meaning soul;
a little trying sometimes, I must admit, but I do not
see much of her just now. I go out a great deal, you
know. Lionel is a most attentive lover.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I thought you told me you were obliged to
be very quiet on account of his mourning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; we do not attend any society functions
unless they are political; but we go for long walks
and drives together, and we spend a good deal of our
time with Lady Montella, who is one of the sweetest
women in the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The Countess regarded her contemplatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you are in love, and flourishing,” she observed,
with a smile. “Well, I am very glad. Long may
it last. Presently I may tell you my news; but it
is such a great secret that I hardly know if I am
justified in trusting you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia looked up with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which means that you will tell me, nevertheless,”
she rejoined. “What is it, Mamie? Something
new?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little Countess nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something very new; but I am not going to
divulge until after lunch. I am too hungry to talk
secrets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lunch was a somewhat dreary affair. The Earl
seemed to consider it his duty to lead the conversation;
and as he was a peculiarly absent-minded
man, his efforts were not entirely successful. The
Countess, having started her host on the subject of
one of his hobbies, confined her attention to her
favourite mayonnaise, whilst Patricia, like a dutiful
daughter, supplemented her father’s disquisitions
by the most intelligent questions she could muster.
When it was over, the ladies adjourned to Patricia’s
boudoir, which was the cosiest room in the house. It
was decorated in the style of the Renaissance, and
the few pictures on the walls were of the choicest.
Patricia loved to surround herself with pretty things
but she also possessed a leaning towards the antique.
There was on her little table—itself of ancient origin—a
gold snuff-box, which belonged originally to
George I.; an old Roman coin, said to be one of the
thirty pieces of silver for which Judas Iscariot sold
our Lord; the quill pen with which the sentence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Lady Jane Grey was signed; and various other
articles of vertu. There was also a small oaken
prie-dieu, with the inscription which St. Paul found
at Athens displayed above it: “<em>To the Unknown
God</em>”; and there was an exquisite marble bust of the
late Countess Torrens, Patricia’s mother. There
were <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">editions de luxe</span></i> of the works of Patricia’s
favourite poets, and as many photographs of the said
poets as could be obtained. In the bow window,
which overlooked the square, an old-fashioned
harpsichord was placed; here Lady Chesterwood
seated herself, and began to play.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tone of the instrument was mellow, but the
fingers of the Countess were stiff. Pianoforte-playing
had quite gone out of fashion, for the mechanisms
for automatic pianoforte-playing—by means of an
attachment to the instrument—were so perfect and
in such general use that it was really a waste of
energy for a person to manipulate the keys in the
old way. This ancient harpsichord, however, was
spared the indignity of a mechanical addition.
Patricia was too deeply imbued with the sense of
the fitness of things to have allowed it, even had it
been possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you given up wearing a brooch, or have
you lost it, Pat?” Lady Chesterwood asked suddenly.
She was watching her all the time she played.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia involuntarily put up her hand to her collar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither,” she answered promptly. “I have given
it away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Given it away? You foolish girl!” The Countess
ceased playing, whilst a look of astonishment crossed
her face. “You don’t mean to say it was the diamond
spray you always wear?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Yes; the one father gave me after I was ill two
years ago. I gave it to the Unemployed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Patricia! Are you mad? Please explain
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia blushed. “There is not much to explain,”
she rejoined. “Lionel and I happened to come
across the procession of the Unemployed—perhaps
you have seen it yourself? Yes? Then you know
how it makes one’s blood run cold to see the misery
on their faces. I had only a little money to put in
the collecting-box, so I gave my brooch. If they can
sell it, it will do them more good than myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Preposterous!” the Countess exclaimed. “Why,
it was worth at least two hundred pounds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So much the better; even if they get only a
hundred, it will go towards buying bread. And I
shall not even miss it—I have so many trinkets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her cousin shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I won’t say any more,” she said. “You
always were one of the most absurdly quixotic
creatures of my acquaintance. I should not be at all
surprised if you ended by beggaring yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case, I shall appeal to you for assistance,”
Patricia answered, with a smile. “But do not let
us talk about myself. Tell me your great secret,
Mamie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Presently. There is plenty of time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia glanced at her with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are making a great mystery of it,” she
remarked. “Whom does it concern?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Chesterwood’s fingers pressed the keys once
more. There was a peculiar expression on her face,
and a new gleam seemed to come into her eyes. She
was a pretty woman, and possessed the indefinable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>charm which generally associates itself with young
widows. She turned round slowly on the music-stool, and faced Patricia with a glance which almost
betrayed a touch of defiance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The secret concerns myself and a man,” she
replied slowly. “A great man.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> LADY CHESTERWOOD’S SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Patricia’s interest deepened. “A great man?” she
repeated. “In what way is he great?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Countess rose with an air of mystery, and
closed the door, which had been left ajar. Then
she established herself comfortably in one of the
beautifully carved chairs, and assumed a look of
importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First of all, dear,” she said impressively, “you
must promise absolute secrecy. I must have your
word of honour that you won’t tell a living soul, not
even Lionel Montella.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will readily promise not to tell any of my
friends,” Patricia answered, “but I have no secrets
from Lionel. Is this necessary?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Absolutely. I would not have Montella know
for worlds. Perhaps I am foolish in telling you, Pat,
but I know I can trust you if you promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl hesitated. She was not sure that she
cared to be told anything which must be expressly
kept back from her lover; but after a few moments’
consideration she yielded. After all, it might not be
of much importance—a love-affair probably, for the
Countess was still quite young.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I promise,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On your word of honour?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“On my word of honour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Chesterwood’s expression was inscrutable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I will tell you,” she said, after a moment’s
pause. “I have received an offer of marriage from
Mr. Athelstan Moore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had she received an offer of marriage from his
Satanic Majesty, her cousin could not have looked
more aghast. She started to her feet, the colour
ebbing from her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From Athelstan Moore?” she repeated, in a voice
of excitement. “But surely you will not accept it?
You cannot accept it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Countess clasped her hands at the back of her
head, and regarded her cousin imperturbably.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?” she asked, with irritating calmness.
“I am only twenty-six, and tired of my widowhood.
There is no earthly reason why I should not marry
again. What could be more satisfactory than a
widow with one little boy marrying a widower with
one little girl? And Athelstan Moore is one of the
first men in England, and has been angled for by
every girl in society since his wife died. I should be
very foolish if I did not give his proposal very careful
consideration.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia paced the room in agitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you loved my Cousin Chesterwood,”
she said. “I did not think you would be faithless to
his memory so soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have no right to use the word ‘faithless,’”
the Countess returned, with a touch of hauteur. “I
made Chesterwood a true wife while he lived; I have
nothing to reproach myself with where he is concerned.
But I have always had the desire for power.
I am tired of being a mere society puppet with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>coronet. As wife of the Prime Minister I should
shine in a manner after my own heart. There is a
certain fascination in helping to pull the wires which
govern the State.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would help to accomplish the downfall of
Lionel Montella’s race?” said Patricia, her face
hardening. “I had thought our friendship was tried
and true, Mamie; but it seems that, like everything
else, it is only transient, seeing that you are so willing
to relinquish it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! You are too much given to high-falutin’,
Pat. Be sensible. Why should the
Premier’s wife be considered unworthy of your
friendship?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not a case of ‘unworthiness’ at all. The
Premier is the enemy of my future husband and of
his co-religionists. If you marry him, it is not possible
that you can still be my greatest friend. There
can be no intercourse between your house and mine.
Do you not understand? Mr. Moore would probably
forbid you to visit or receive me, and Lionel would
have to do the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not quite see it,” the Countess returned
obdurately. “Politics need not interfere with a
private and personal friendship. I think you exaggerate
the matter, my dear. Why, I might even
influence Moore on behalf of Montella’s cause. I
might be the saviour of Judaism, and receive the
thanks of every Jew in the kingdom. Instead of
becoming your enemy, I might prove myself in very
truth your friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes glistened at the picture her imagination
had painted. She would prove what a tremendous
influence a woman could have over a man, and how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>her feminine will, as frail as gossamer, yet as strong
as iron, could decide the destiny of a whole race.
Here would be something worth accomplishing, a
feat at least worthy of the attempt. To subjugate
the invincible will of Athelstan Moore! Her face
glowed with a foretaste of the charm of such a battle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia was doubtful, but her features relaxed.
She wondered if the Countess, whose nature she had
always considered somewhat shallow, would have the
strength of purpose to fulfil her words. If she could
succeed, what a glorious victory it would be! The
thought caused her heart to leap and her eyes to
deepen. She paused in front of her dead cousin’s
wife, and held out her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you do this, Mamie?” she asked, in a
tense voice. “Would you really espouse our cause?
Oh, it would be so grand, so blessed a thing! Read
the history of the Jews, and you will see what a long-suffering
people they are, surely more sinned against
than sinning. It is we who are to blame—we Gentiles,
who, in the name of Christianity, have persecuted
them throughout the ages, who have inflicted on
them the tortures of the Inquisition, who have denied
them the rights accorded to other civilised beings.
The Jews are the elder brothers of the human race,
and to hate them is to hate the God who made them.
Long before Greece and Rome held sway over the
world, <em>they</em> had their kings, warriors, poets, and
philosophers. Has there ever been in the world’s
history a greater king and philosopher than Solomon,
a greater warrior than Judas the Maccabee, a greater
poet than the Psalmist, a greater athlete than Samson,
a greater Christian than Paul the Apostle?—and all
these men were Jews. Oh, if you could only make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Athelstan Moore and his followers see the uselessness
and iniquity of anti-Semitism, you would do a work
which would endear you to the hearts of hundreds!
But will you do it? Have you the power to carry
out your determination? Have you the moral
courage to risk incurring the disapproval of society?
It is no trivial matter. Think—think what it
means!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her hands unclasped and fell to her side; her face
was unlifted in appeal. She was evidently actuated
by a great sincerity and earnestness; and Lady
Chesterwood’s playful rejoinder froze on her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sweet little enthusiast!” she exclaimed, moved
in spite of herself. “Montella is lucky in winning
your love. It is your love which casts the roseate
hue over the Jewish people, dear, and you see I do
not possess the same incentive. Still, I will do my
best, and if I marry Athelstan Moore, I promise you
that I shall not lack the courage to voice your
opinions. I would rather remain your friend than
become your enemy, and the idea of thwarting the
Premier pleases me mightily. It is like David with
his little sling and stone attacking the formidable
Goliath, or the tiny mouse gnawing the rope which
great men cannot break. The world shall see, as it
has seen before, what a beautiful woman can do.
Have no fear, my dear child, I know I shall
succeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Self-assurance had ever been the keynote to the
success of Mamie Chesterwood’s family. From a
mere clerk in an engineering office in Baltimore, with
little more than his pride of descent from the Pilgrim
Fathers to sustain him, her father had risen to the
wealth and power of an American copper king. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a matter of course, both his daughters had married
titles, Mamie’s elder sister, Olive, being the wife of
Prince Charles of Felsen-Schvoenig. It was no
wonder, therefore, that Mamie herself had inherited a
love of overcoming difficulties, and of mounting from
one high position to another. She knew that by
marrying Athelstan Moore she would partially lose
her freedom; but she felt that this would amply be
compensated for by the exciting situations which
would probably affect her as Premier’s wife. So by
the time her conversation with Patricia came to an
end, she had made up her mind to accept the offer
of her would-be swain. She asked her cousin for pen
and paper, and wrote the answer then and there.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was always a little of her own notepaper in
Patricia’s desk, so that she did not have to use Earl
Torrens’ address. Patricia watched her as she wrote,
and wondered what the ultimate result would be.
Was the Countess unconsciously making trouble for
herself, or was she really paving the way of freedom
for the British Jews? Who could look into the
future, and foresee the consequence of her act?
Only time would show.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I not tell Lionel?” the girl asked eagerly,
when the letter was sealed. “Why should he be
kept in ignorance of the matter? He may be able
to offer some advice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Countess shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the present I do not wish him to know,” she
rejoined. “I must hold you to your promise, Pat.
Remember, you gave me your word of honour. Soon
it will be in all the society papers. You will not
have to wait long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia said no more; and soon afterwards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Countess took her departure. When she had gone,
the girl remained long in her boudoir, deep in
thought. Was it Providence, or merely the irony of
fate, that caused her greatest friend to become the
wife of her greatest enemy, she wondered. If only
she might talk it over with her lover when he came;
but she was bound to silence. The fire burned low,
and as the shadows gathered, a shadow seemed to
oppress her heart. Presently a footman brought her
some tea, and tried to make the room more cosy by
stirring the fire and drawing the velvet curtains
together. Certainly the electric lamps, under their
golden shades, conduced to cheerfulness more than
the grey twilight. But the sense of loneliness was
not dispelled, and crept closer as the hours lengthened.
At six o’clock Mrs. Lowther returned, and expounded
on all the events of the day; but her companionship
was not of the kind that the girl needed, and she
was glad when it was time to dress. Her lover did
not arrive until much later—just when she had given
him up, and was contemplating bed. He had come
straight from the House, and burst into the room
with an impetuosity she had never seen in him
before. His face was so pale, and his eyes so bright,
that instinctively she knew that something was
wrong. Being aware of the presence of her chaperon,
he said not a word, but took both her hands in
silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Lowther, with unusual tact, gathered up her
belongings, and uttering a trivial excuse, sailed
majestically out of the room. Patricia gave a sigh of
relief, but she was in a flutter of suspense.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your hands are as cold as ice, dear,” she said,
with concern. “What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“The very worst!” was his reply, in a voice which
was hoarse with emotion—“worse than anything I
had anticipated even in my wildest dreams. Athelstan
Moore has declared open antagonism towards
my people. To-night a Bill came up for its first
reading in Parliament—a Bill for the banishment of
all the Jews!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the Jews?” the girl repeated questioningly.
“The pauper aliens, you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, <em>all</em> the Jews, both English and foreign, rich and
poor. Moore does not intend to do things by halves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Preposterous!” she exclaimed—“preposterous!
Surely the man must be mad. Banish the Jews!
Why, anyone can see at first sight that the idea is
totally impracticable. How was it received?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He sank on to a chair, looking almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly know. I was so dumfounded that I
could scarcely move, and the whole place seemed to
spin. The other Members regarded it with equanimity,
and evidently knew something of it before.
I suppose I was purposely kept in the dark. The
House rose before the debate was concluded, and it
will be brought on again to-morrow night. But
think, Patricia, what it will mean. It is enough to
make a man’s senses reel!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl poured him out a glass of wine and made
him take it. If only she had known of this before
Lady Chesterwood had left! Her heart beat like a
sledge-hammer against her breast, and for the
moment she could find no words; but she knew
that her lover needed comfort, and that it was her
duty to help him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Your nerves are unstrung, dear,” she said, in a
soothing voice. “You must go home soon and rest.
I am sure you need not be alarmed, Lionel. The
Bill will never be carried; it cannot, while there is
justice in England. What man in his senses would
counsel intoleration in these days? This is the age of
freedom—of freedom in religious matters most of all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not the Jewish religion that Moore objects
to so much as the Jewish race,” Montella replied, in
a dull voice. “He is as rabid as it is possible for a
Jew-baiter to be, and he has, unfortunately, such a
convincing manner that there are few who can withstand
him. Of course, he made a great deal of the
Consolidated Trust smash and those processions of
the Unemployed. Yet, as you say, the Bill is
impracticable. I do not see how it is possible to
banish the Jews. Where are they to go? The
whole thing is monstrous—absurd!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is, and therefore you must not worry about it,
Lal. You must laugh at it instead. The good-natured
British Public will laugh, I am sure, when
they read of it in the papers to-morrow. And now,
dear, I am not going to talk to you any more to-night.
You must go straight home to bed, and try
to cool that burning forehead of yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose and drew her affectionately towards him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling! You are brave enough to put
courage into any man.” He sighed, and squaring
his shoulders, added: “Well, if it’s fighting they
want, we must fight to the death. But, Patricia, if by
any horrible chance this Bill is passed, it will mean
that I also am included under the ban. It will mean
the emptying out of joy from my life—for it will
mean separation from you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Never!” she exclaimed, almost before the words
had passed his lips. “Your cause is mine, and not
all the devilish designs of Athelstan Moore and his
satellites shall come between us. If you are banished,
then I shall be banished, too. Oh, Lionel, what is
love worth if it fails at such a time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hid her face on his shoulder, her form shaken
with heavy sobs; but she quickly recovered from her
emotion, and regained her self-possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamie Chesterwood was here to-day,” she
informed him, as he went towards the door. “She
is our friend, Lionel, and has promised to stand by
us through thick and thin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has she, dear?” There was little hope in his
voice. He did not seem to think the Countess
would prove an ally of much importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is more in her than we think,” Patricia
added, more cheerfully. “I really believe she will be
of use. She is one of those who have to be fully
persuaded in their own minds before they will do
anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she remembered that her lips were sealed.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX<br /> THE ZIONISTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Montella did not go straight home in spite of
Patricia’s injunction. He turned into the park, and
crossed over to the Serpentine, scarcely knowing
whither his steps were tending. A slight mist hung
over the water, and the air was chilly with the raw
dampness of November. With no sound to break
the stillness, save the echo of his own tread and the
rumble of far-off traffic, he was able to steady his
nerves. Moore’s Bill had given him a blow from
which he could not easily recover; but on due consideration
he came to the conclusion that he had
been unwise to have so openly displayed his agitation.
What he needed were coolness and confidence;
but instead of showing either he had become as
panic-stricken as an animal driven to bay.</p>

<p class='c009'>He flung himself down on a seat, with his back to
the water, and tried to think out his speech for the
morrow. He knew that as the only Jewish member
of any importance in the House, his co-religionists
would look to him to vindicate their claims. On him
had fallen the responsibility of voicing the appeal for
justice of the whole Jewish community, and although
he was but a unit when it came to taking the majority,
it was his duty to oppose the Bill tooth and nail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The absurdity of the Bill would have caused him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>amusement had it not affected him so nearly; for he
could see that endless complications would arise if it
were passed. The banishment of the Jews was a
matter easier said than done, seeing that the yellow
badge and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouelle</span></i> were things of the past. Well,
it would be a fine test for separating true Jews from
false: perhaps persecution would—as it had so often
done before—kindle the smouldering fire of Judaism
into a flame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The newspapers next morning were full of the new
Bill, and despite the fact that many of the newspaper
proprietors were of Hebrew extraction, the attitude
taken up by the majority of the dailies was in favour
of the project. Instead of displaying the sense of
justice and fairplay which has ever been the Englishman’s
boast, the leaders were characterised by envy,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness. The jealousy
which had been kept under for so long a time now
burst forth with uncontrollable fury; to Montella, it
was but the impotent howling of a totally corrupt
press.</p>

<p class='c009'>His speech that night had nothing of the brilliance
of the Premier’s oration, but it was manly and
straight to the point. Like a second Daniel come to
judgment, he stood erect and fearless; and stated his
case with a lucidity which was bound to create a
good impression. While admitting the undesirability
of pauper alien immigration, he considered it the
height of folly to desire to interfere with the peace of
those estimable Jewish citizens who kept the laws and
contributed to the welfare of the country. He asked
his colleagues to look back to the reign of Queen
Victoria—the reign which brought so much emancipation
to the Jews—to note the friendliness with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>which she always treated them, and the consequent
prosperity of England during her reign. He begged
them not to allow the beneficent influence of
Victoria the Good to be dispelled; and appealing
to their common sense as well as their humanity,
endeavoured to point out the disadvantages appertaining
to such a Bill. He certainly had logic on his
side, as well as the certainty that his cause was a
just one; and his words, uttered in a low but distinct
tone, commanded respect. The calmness with which
he spoke contrasted favourably with the lashing
words of the Premier, whose eyes gleamed with a
personal hatred as well as an impersonal conviction.
But despite the justice of Montella’s plea, the general
feeling was against the Jews; and as the whole of
the working-classes supported the Bill, there was
little doubt as to its final issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is madness!” Montella exclaimed, when he
told his mother and Raie of the result. “The people
are all afflicted with Judaphobia; their reasoning
powers are numbed. They will not be satisfied until
they have broken up our homes and driven us away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is there no antidote?” asked Raie wistfully.
“Cannot we come to a compromise of some sort?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is the only one which Mr. Lawson Holmes
suggested in the House this afternoon—assimilation.
We are to sink our racial affinity, one towards
another; give up our Judaism for Theism; attend
Theistic places of worship, if worship in public we
must; pull down our synagogues and burn our
<em>talithim</em>; abstain from clannishness; marry only
Gentiles; and forget our descent. That, says Mr.
Holmes, is the rational solution of the whole question.
Assimilation is the means by which we are to wriggle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>out of the difficulty. Of course, it applies only to us
British Jews.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt there are many who will think that a
very sensible course,” said Lady Montella. “Still I
am surprised that if the racial prejudice is really so
strong the Gentiles should desire the admixture with
English blood. Ah—” as a maid approached bearing
a card on a silver salver, “someone to see you, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dr. Engelmacher!” exclaimed Lionel, with
pleasure, as he took up the card. “I had no idea
that he was in London. Show him in here please,
Mary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dr. Engelmacher!” repeated Lady Montella, her
eyes brightening at the name. “He must have come
here for some special purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Max Engelmacher was the great leader of the
Zionists in Germany, a man whose fame had spread
throughout every Jewish centre. In appearance he
was a typical German, with fair hair, light blue eyes
covered with spectacles, and rugged features. No
less Oriental-looking man could ever have been found;
nevertheless, he was a very Jew of the Jews—to some
a second Moses ready to lead his people to the
promised land, to others the one who should come in
the power and spirit of Elijah before the advent of
the national Messiah. As a young man he—in
common with others—had seen his visions and
dreamed his dreams; but experience had hardened
him into a genial cynic who was practical before
everything else.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella rose as his burly figure blocked the
doorway, and held out her hand with almost the first
smile which had passed across her face since her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>husband’s death. There was no doubt as to the
sincerity of her welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This bad business has had one good effect, since it
has brought you here,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bad business indeed, lady,” he replied, in
German. “Yet if it stirs up some of you English
Jews to action, I shall not call it altogether bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think we are too cold, eh, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cold? <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Um Gotteswillen!</span></i> yes. You sit at home
in your fine houses, with your maids and footmen,
your electric light and your telephone, and you will
scarcely spare a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">nebbich</span></i><a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> for those of your own race
who are hounded from one place to another, who are
scarcely allowed to take a free breath of God’s air
because they are Jews. You metaphorically gather
your skirts together lest you should be defiled by
contact with those whom you choose to call the scum
of the earth; but you do not take the trouble to
consider what has brought them so low. And you
tie up your heart-strings and your purse-strings tight,
lest you should be tempted to throw good money
away. Cold! You are a nation of icebergs, so
civilised and anglicised that what feeling you ever
possessed has been refined out of you long ago.
That is my opinion of the English Jews, madam. I
am bound to speak the truth.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. “Poor things!”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Dear old Engelmacher!” exclaimed Montella,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</span></i>. “A voice of thunder, and a heart of
gold!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he turned to the mighty pioneer, and entered
upon a serious conversation concerning the present
crisis. It was a relief to him to be able to open his
heart.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The doctor, having obtained permission, lit up
his old and well-beloved briar, and puffed away in
silence. He always believed that his pipe assisted
his mental digestion, and never troubling to study
conventionalities, was not deterred by the presence of
the ladies. Lady Montella was too much interested
in the discussion to mind the smoke. She considered
this an opportunity which should certainly not be
lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is money we want,” the doctor said, when the
whole situation had been explained. “Another two
millions, and Palestine will be ours. I have the
best authority for saying this; our colleague Karl
Lierhammer had an audience with the Sultan last
week. Only one hundred thousand pounds is needed
to allow us to start operations north-west of the
Jordan at once, and I can lay my hands on fifty
thousand Jewish artisans who are ready to begin.
So you see our dream is not so far from being
realised after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella’s face glowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How splendidly you have worked while we
thought the movement was at a standstill,” she said.
“You may count on us for the hundred thousand;
we will raise it among ourselves and our relations.
We can safely promise this, I think?” she added,
addressing her son.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We do not require the money as a donation,” Dr.
Engelmacher explained. “It will all go into the
national debt. Palestine will be a self-supporting
country in a comparatively short time; the fertility
of the land is remarkable. Will you believe me, dear
people, when I tell you that before the Zionist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>movement was conceived, that country was barren
from lack of water; but that since we began our
operations there the rain has fallen in due season,
and all Nature has conduced to further our aim?<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
Is not this a testimony—if such we need—to the
righteousness of our cause?”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. A fact attested by the Rev. Dr. Gaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wonderful!” exclaimed Lady Montella, with
glad surprise. “Yet people say that miracles do not
happen nowadays. Why, even Christians believe
that we are to be restored to our own land—the
land of promise. Strange that some of the Jews
themselves should be so reluctant to act on that
belief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strange indeed,” returned the doctor. “I believe
that prosperity and freedom have combined to dim
their spiritual vision. They live only for the present,
and being happy themselves, they are incapable of
feeling for their persecuted brethren abroad. Ah, if
I can only succeed in arousing the interest of all the
rich Jews in England so far as to make them invest
their money Zionwards, our cause will be won. It is
for this purpose that I have come here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If England expels the Jews, I’m afraid she will
regret it before many months are past,” said Montella
thoughtfully. “I believe the Government will not
have the best side of the bargain after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Government will find itself in the biggest
pickle it has ever known,” was Dr. Engelmacher’s
reply. “It is safe to say that when anti-Semitism
attacks a country, that country is in a state of decline.
England, the justice-loving happy queen of nations,
will soon find out her mistake. She is but passing
through a phase; she will come through the cloud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>strengthened and purified. I know and love the
English people well enough to be certain of this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you think—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think nothing yet, my dear Montella. I
prefer to wait for the course of events. For the
present I must say <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Auf Wiedersehen</span></i>. I shall see
you again before I leave London, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose, and politely declining Lady Montella’s
cordial invitation to dinner, took his departure; but
they saw him again at a huge Zionist meeting on the
following night. The hall was packed from door to
door, rich and poor uniting for once under the sense
of common danger. Like a drowning man catches at
a straw, they clung to the new hope which was presented
to them; for with anti-Semitism brought so
near home, they could no longer afford to ignore the
burning question. And what a hope it was that,
clothed though it was in foreign accents, breathed
through Engelmacher’s words! A land of their very
own, where persecution would be forgotten, where
they could lift their heads in freedom, and win back
their good name. The promised land of their forefathers
and of their glorious past—the promised land
of the future, where they should behold the long-looked-for
coming of the King! No wonder that
their stricken hearts were inflamed by the national
hope. The voices of the prophets—to which for so
long they had turned deaf ears—were reaching them
at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>Who could tell what new revelations they might
not have to unfold?</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER X<br /> PREMIER AND PEERESS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The new Grand Imperial Hotel at Brighton was
very full; for it had become the fashion once again
to spend the week-end away from town, and the
Grand Imperial was the hotel temporarily favoured,
not so much by the so-called “smart set” as by those
who were popularly supposed to possess brains.
Jaded barristers, glad to forget for the moment that
there existed such a place as the Inner Temple, a
trio of actor-managers who were “resting”; two or
three of the most beautiful women in society, and a
sprinkling of clerics were included among the guests.
To-night—Saturday—the Right Hon. Athelstan
Moore was expected, and the hotel complement
would be complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the hour between tea and dinner—the
children’s hour. Those who were not imbibing the
salubrious air along the promenade were gathered in
the lounge, whilst the children—there were not many—played
hide-and-seek around the Corinthian pillars
and behind the numerous Chesterfield couches. One
of them, a tiny boy of scarcely five summers, was
playing horses with a little girl three years his senior,
and racing up and down as fast as his little legs
would carry him, seemed bubbling over with health
and merriment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“You go too slow, Phyllis,” he piped, almost out
of breath with his mimic galloping and plunging.
“Why don’t you run?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Phyllis Moore loosened the reins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I run I shall make myself tired,” she replied
demurely. “My governess told me to play quietly.
I am going to wait up for father to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The air of maiden superiority jarred upon the
little boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will wait up for father, too,” he announced
sturdily. “Let’s both wait up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Phyllis looked more superior than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very silly, Leslie,” she returned. “How
can you wait up for your father when he is dead?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s dead?” demanded Leslie, with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dead? Oh, it’s being put down in a hole in the
ground and being covered with a lot of nasty earth,
and then having a great flat stone plumped down on
top of you. That’s what your father is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t,” denied Leslie, with indignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is, or else you would not be the Earl of
Chesterwood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t!” Leslie stamped his foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t. You are a horrid little girl, and I don’t
like you a bit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Children, what are you quarrelling about?” said
a lady’s voice from behind one of the pillars. “It is
very naughty to quarrel. Come and tell me what is
the matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Leslie dissolved into tears, and hid his face in the
folds of his mother’s skirt, whilst Phyllis stood by
abashed. Lady Chesterwood, not wishing to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>her gown marred by her son’s emotion, produced a
small cambric handkerchief, and placed it between
the child’s face and her skirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” she said, addressing herself to Phyllis,
“why did you make Leslie cry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t make him cry,” the Premier’s daughter
answered sulkily. “I only told him his father was
dead. It is quite true. His father <em>is</em> dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t,” came from Leslie, in a stifled voice.
“She says my father is in a hole in the ground, with
a lot of nasty earth and a stone on top of him; and
he isn’t! My father doesn’t live in a hole.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Countess maintained a calm demeanour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your father is above the bright blue sky with the
angels, sonnie,” she said soothingly. “Don’t you
remember that I told you he had gone away to
heaven?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.” Leslie raised his head triumphantly, and
glowered at Phyllis. “My father is in heaven with
the angels. I knew he wasn’t down a nasty hole in
the ground!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Phyllis, still unconvinced, stalked away to rejoin her
governess, and the Countess was spared the necessity
of entering further into the problem. She wondered
what Leslie would have to say if she were to provide
him with a new father, and how he and Phyllis
would agree. The letter which she had dashed off in
Patricia’s boudoir had never been sent, for she had
thought better of it before she reached home. She
had not yet given a definite answer to her illustrious
wooer, although a month had passed, but she knew
that he was coming to Brighton expressly to hear
what she had to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the nurse came for her boy, she went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>rejoin the sister with whom she was staying—the
Princess Charles von Felsen-Schvoenig. She felt
unusually nervous, and could not settle down anywhere.
The bravado she had shown in her conversation
with Patricia had gradually evaporated until
there was little left. The nearer it came to meeting
the Premier the less courageous did she feel. She
was not at all sure now that she considered it worth
while to become the defender of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess was very much like her sister in
appearance, but possessed stronger features and a
firmer will. She considered Mamie foolish to wish to
encumber herself with another husband, and to give
up her widowed freedom. Her own husband—with
whom she was not in love—was suffering with a
disease of the spine; and as he allowed himself to be
relegated to the castle in Felsen-Schvoenig whenever
his presence was undesired by his wife, the Princess
enjoyed life in her own way as a woman of independence.
She was fond of travelling, and journeyed
from one place to another as she felt inclined.
Perhaps there was scarcely a wife in the whole of
Europe so little troubled by domestic affairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So the hour approaches!” she exclaimed, as her
sister appeared in her boudoir. “Whence the pale
cheeks and troubled brow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I pale?” The Countess glanced at herself
in the mirror. “I shall have plenty of colour when the
lights are lit. I feel real stupid to-day; I don’t
know why. When Moore begins rolling off his
words to me in that curious manner of his, I know I
shall have nothing to say for myself in return. I
might be a girl in her first season instead of a widow
and a woman of the world. And I just wanted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>be especially brilliant to-night. It’s very annoying,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess regarded her contemplatively. “I
believe you are afraid of Moore,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afraid? What nonsense. As if I could be
frightened of a little man scarcely a head taller
than myself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little man certainly, but he has a great
personality. It is said that the man or woman does
not exist who can oppose Moore’s iron will. It is
true enough that when he determines on a thing,
that thing always comes to pass. Therefore, my dear
Mamie, you will know what to expect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui vivra verra</span></i>,” returned her sister, as the
dressing-bell resounded through the hotel; and then,
with a careless nod, she left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked much better when, an hour later, she
descended to the salon. Her gown of filmy chiffon
and lace suited her to perfection, and anticipation had
lent a touch of colour to her cheeks. The Princess,
who was in black relieved and studded by gems
which glittered with every ray of light, glanced at
her with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Moore is here,” she announced quietly. “He
arrived about ten minutes ago, and has gone up to
see Phyllis and dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless the Premier was absent from the
dinner-table, and the Countess was kept on tenter-hooks
until the gentlemen rejoined the ladies, when
she noticed his short, thick-set figure at the entrance
to the lounge. The band in the north gallery had
begun the overture to Faust, and his coming was—by
a coincidence—heralded by the martial tones of
the Soldiers’ Chorus. She put down the untasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>cup of coffee on the little table at her side, and trifled
nervously with the diamond collar on her neck. The
next moment she had shaken hands and was
exchanging commonplaces with the first man in
England. Her nervousness suddenly vanished,
leaving her natural and free.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Press had often remarked on the apparent
likeness between the Premier and Napoleon the
Great. Certainly Athelstan Moore possessed eagle-eyes,
a Roman nose, and somewhat round and
stooping shoulders, and the brusqueness of his
manner considerably strengthened the effect. He
jerked out his words in the tone of one accustomed
to command, and was absolutely devoid of the saving
sense of humour. That was why some people found
his society somewhat trying. He never could—or
would—receive a joke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are late,” the Countess said, as she made
room for him beside her. “I expected you long
ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I was detained in town. I could have been
down to dinner, however, had not Phyllis insisted on
my staying with her until she went to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a curious fact that while the Premier never
suffered himself to be dictated to by those whose
powers of thought equalled his own, he was as wax
in the hands of his child. The Countess smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phyllis has been quarrelling with my little
Leslie,” she informed him, with pretended gravity.
“It is strange that they two can never agree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose it is because the girl is older than the
boy,” he returned thoughtfully. “A boy does not
like to be commanded by a girl, even if she be older
than himself. I must have a serious talk with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Phyllis. I do not wish her to quarrel with anyone,
least of all your little boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He laid stress on the pronoun. The Countess
knew what he meant, but she said nothing, and
turned over the pages of her book with apparent
carelessness. The lounge was filling, and the music
ceased. Espying the figure of a well-known political
bore opposite, Moore leant farther back in shadow.
He knew that if he were noticed he would be called
upon to talk politics for the remainder of the evening;
and although it was true that his life was bound up
in his beloved Government, he was not anxious to
enter into a controversy just now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish to speak to you, Mamie,” he said, lowering
his voice. “Will you come out on the terrace? It
is a glorious night; and if you put on a wrap you
will not feel cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Countess rose obediently, and sent for her
fur-lined cloak. It was just like a man to think that
a bare neck and arms could be sufficiently protected
by a flimsy “wrap.” The night was certainly calm,
but as it was winter it could scarcely be otherwise
than chilly. The terrace was deserted, save for a
young man who was enjoying a smoke at the far
end. Moore drew the young widow to a rustic seat
at the most sheltered corner. There was no sound
save the swish of the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Athelstan Moore was not the man to indulge in
sentimentality. He paid no heed to the moon and
the stars and the stillness, but came to the point at
once. Lady Chesterwood had been given a month
to consider his offer of marriage, and as the time had
expired, he awaited her answer now.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Chesterwood was still undecided.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“You say you wish to marry me because you are
particularly drawn towards me,” she said evenly.
“But in your position as head of the State, is it wise
to saddle yourself with a wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amare simul et sapere ipsi jovi non datur</span></i>,’”
he quoted lightly. “Besides, I think it expedient for
a Prime Minister to be married, since his wife can
perform her duty to the State socially as hostess.
Mrs. Moore, as you know, died a year after our
marriage—when Phyllis was born. Don’t you think
I owe a duty also to my motherless child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>If there was a tender spot in the Premier’s heart, it
was for his little girl. Mamie knew it, and thought
she recognised what had prompted the man’s
desire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You want a mother for Phyllis?” she asked softly.
“Am I not right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but I also want you for myself. It is not
good for man to be alone, especially a man so
harassed and worried by the affairs of the nation as
I am. When a fellow’s brain is so severely taxed
that sometimes the whole universe seems out of joint,
he longs for the sympathy of an intelligent woman to
steady his nerves. I am not a young man, and I do
not offer you the passionate devotion which a hotheaded
youth lavishes on a young girl in her teens;
but I will do my best to make you a good husband,
Mamie; and as you are a sensible woman, I think
you will understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamie did understand, and experienced a feeling
of gratification. It seemed strange to hear Moore—the
ostensibly stony-hearted, hard-headed Prime
Minister—talk in this strain. It showed that, strong
as he was, he was not too strong to be able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>dispense with sympathy. It showed that, in spite of
all the logic of dry-as-dust professors, there was a
force to be reckoned with in love.</p>

<p class='c009'>The music had begun again, and the seductive
strains of a valse floated out towards them. The
waves, as they broke at regular intervals upon the
beach, seemed to beat time to the melody, and the
seething foam rushing backwards on the pebbles
added a refrain. A sense of unreality affected the
little Countess as she listened; it seemed almost as if
she were living the past over again. She had had
acquaintance with the man beside her for at least
three years, but she had never liked him so well as at
this moment. Perhaps it was because she saw him
in a new light, and felt the undoubted fascination of
his virile personality. She forgot the many stories
she had heard of his despotic dealings, forgot altogether
his hatred of the Jews. She remembered only
that he was a great man, and that he had come to
<em>her</em> for sympathy. Was it a wonder that her small
features glowed with pride!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will marry you because you want me,” she said,
in a gentle voice at last, “and I will try and do my
duty to your motherless girl, as I hope you will to my
fatherless boy. But you will be good to me, won’t
you, Athelstan?” she added, almost wistfully. “You
will be our protector—Leslie’s and mine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised her hand to his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be my first care to protect you,” he replied,
well pleased, although he had known all along that
she would consent. And he decided that the marriage
should take place in six weeks’ time; there was no
occasion for a further delay.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was getting cold, and Mamie suggested an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>adjournment within. They repassed the young man
on their way, still unconcernedly smoking his cigar.
The Princess watched their return, but failed to
deduce from their manner what had happened.
Before retiring to rest, however, she presented
herself in her sister’s apartment. She was curious to
know the result.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamie was sitting in front of her dressing-table
shedding tears—though whether of joy or sadness
she did not herself know. She felt as though she
had just come through an ordeal, which, paradoxically,
had not been an ordeal after all. She dried her eyes
hastily, declaring that she was a goose; to which
statement her sister unhesitatingly agreed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamie pushed back her chair, and regarded her
with an unnecessary expression of defiance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s all settled,” she said carelessly. “I am
just going to write to Poppa. We shall be married
on the 10th of February if the fates propend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess gave her a sisterly kiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you know your own business best, so I
will congratulate you,” she remarked. “Did you keep
your promise to Patricia and impose some condition
about the Jews?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamie shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would not have been wise to ruffle Athelstan’s
feelings just then by talking about the Jews,” was her
reply. “To tell you the truth, I entirely forgot their
existence. However, there is time yet. I will
introduce the subject to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was not over-anxious to show the red rag to
the bull.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br /> THE PREMIER OUTWITTED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next day Lady Chesterwood sat down and
wrote the following letter to her husband’s cousin:</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Patricia</span>,—I have just been up
Queen’s Road to see Athelstan off by the 6.40 to
town, but he will be here again in the middle of the
week (Parliament permitting), so the parting will not
be for long. Not forgetting my promise to you, I
had a long conversation with him this afternoon on
the Jewish question, and as you know his feelings on
the matter, I think I was <em>most courageous</em> in introducing
the subject at all. He says that the affair has
now passed out of his hands, and that in speaking as
he did, he merely voiced the opinion of the great
bulk of the British workmen. That the Bill will be
passed is an absolute certainty, and he thinks the
Edict of Banishment will be proclaimed in about a
month from now. I then told him about your
engagement to Mr. Montella, and he said it was
<em>absolutely suicidal</em> on your part to become the wife
of a Jew. He was so angry about it that I dared not
say a word in defence. He has begged me to do my
utmost to persuade you to break off the engagement;
and really, Patricia, I think you will be <em>most foolish</em> if
you persist. Have you not realised that, as the wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of Montella, you will either be banned and cut in
society, or else you will have to be separated from
him when the new Act comes into force? I don’t
know what your father can be about that he does not
interfere. Athelstan intends to pay him a visit
during the course of the week, to acquaint him of
his duty. Don’t think me unkind for taking this
view of the matter. What I really desire is your
<em>ultimate</em> happiness.—Ever your affectionate cousin,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Mamie Chesterwood</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The caligraphy was somewhat sprawling in effect,
and much underlined. A student of graphology
would have noticed weakness, and a disposition easily
amenable to persuasion in the unconnected and carelessly
formed characters. Patricia absorbed the
contents of the letter with very little surprise.
Knowing how easy it was to influence the Countess
in almost any direction, she had been certain all
along that the Prime Minister would soon persuade
her to his way of thinking. That was why she
had been so horror-stricken at Mamie’s anticipated
engagement to Moore.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier did not pay his visit that week, but he
came before the month was out. The Earl received
him in the state drawing-room, and listened attentively
to what he had to say. He and Moore had been at
Balliol together, and although they had never been
actual friends, they had always entertained a mutual
respect for each other. Therefore he did not think
of resenting the Minister’s interference in the matter,
and went so far as to acknowledge the apparent
reasonableness of his opinions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless he did not consider it necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>be greatly concerned. If it had been his son who
wished to marry a Jewess, the case would have been
different; he seemed to think a daughter of much
less consequence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Patricia is of age and able to decide for herself,”
he said, with an air of nonchalance. “As she makes
her bed, so must she lie upon it—that is all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is such a disgrace,” persisted Moore,
determined on carrying his point. “It is a case
which will excite public comment, and therefore is
not merely a personal matter. For the sake of
example it ought not to be allowed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl’s face was impassive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it you object to?” he asked. “The race
or the religion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Both, though if Montella dropped his Judaism it
would not be so bad. But Montella never will; the
matter will be solved by your daughter joining the
Jewish Church. That is where the disgrace comes
in—for a woman in these days of grace to voluntarily
go back to the religion of the pre-Christian Era, to
fling away the Christianity which has done more
than anything else to civilise the world. Why, it’s
absolutely ridiculous. She might just as well put
away her modern dress, education, and culture. I
have never known such an absurd thing in my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid my daughter is angry with Christianity
just now,” said the Earl imperturbably, “since it is
used as a cloak to cover the persecution of the Jews.
She thinks the end does not justify the means.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! she does not understand anything at
all about it. The rulers of the State have to look far
ahead; what we legislate now is for the benefit of
the future generations. It is surely better that these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>people should be expelled than that the whole nation
should suffer later on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He paced up and down the room, his face crimson
with indignation. He could have shaken the noble
Earl for being so dense as not to see the enormity of
the situation. He continued to harangue him for
another forty minutes, until the Earl was so weary
that he promised faithfully to insist on the dissolution
of the betrothal. Then just as he was about to
conclude his remarks, the door opened to admit the
happy—or unhappy—pair. To the Premier their
appearance was most opportune.</p>

<p class='c009'>They both bowed to the visitor, but neither
attempted to shake hands. Patricia, forgetting that
he was Mamie Chesterfield’s fiancé, saw in him only
the virulent Jew-hater, and could not bring herself to
give him a friendly greeting, even though at this
particular moment she felt at peace with all the
world. Montella looked unusually flushed, but the
anxious expression which had been his of late had
vanished, and there was an eager glow in his eyes.
He took not the slightest notice of the Premier’s
glance of hatred, and stood by his sweetheart’s side
with an air of self-possession. He knew, without
requiring to be told, that the visit of his enemy was
in some way connected with himself; but an event
had happened which caused him to view this visit
with equanimity almost amounting to unconcern.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was raw and cold, but Patricia was dressed
in the palest shade of grey, the delicate appearance
of which was enhanced by the choice white flowers
at her breast and attached to her ermine muff. She
looked so fair and radiant, that Athelstan Moore’s
indignation increased, and he determined yet again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>that this beautiful girl should not be lost to England
and the Church by becoming Montella’s bride. He
asked for an interview with her and her father, minus
the presence of her lover; but to this request the girl
refused to accede. She was quite willing to listen to
whatever the Premier might wish to say, but it must
be said before Mr. Montella or not at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier met the steady glance from her grey
eyes without flinching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Lady Patricia, you give me no alternative
but to speak out my mind before one to whom
my words must be extremely disagreeable,” he said,
with a glance at Montella. “I will not beat about
the bush then; I will come to the point at once. I
have just had a long conversation with your father,
in which I have tried to point out to him the many
disadvantages which would accrue from your marriage
with Mr. Montella. Not to mention the many minor
points which I might put forth for his consideration
and yours, I will repeat three great impedimenta to
such a marriage. Firstly, you would have to become
an apostate from the Christian religion—an action,
the gravity of which it is possible you could not
realise for many years; secondly, you would be
ostracised by society, and for your father’s sake you
should remember the motto <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse oblige</span></i>—you are
not justified in renouncing your birthright; and
thirdly, you would perform an action contrary to the
spirit and temper of the nation at the present time,
by not only advocating the Jewish cause, but by
becoming the wife of a Jew. These three reasons
are surely of sufficient weight to deter you from such
a course, especially as you would give not only
personal, but national offence. Of course I take it for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>granted that you are not actuated purely by a
motive of selfishness. I presume that you are not
unwilling to weigh the pros and cons of the case?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia had sunk on to one of the little Chippendale
chairs, and was looking up at him with an air
of artlessness, whilst the Earl and Montella stood
inertly by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind to take so much interest in me,
Mr. Moore,” she said quietly, when he had finished.
“May I be so bold as to inquire the reason?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly; the reason is not far to seek. Having
the honour and pleasure of your acquaintance, your
contemplated marriage would grieve me inexpressibly.
And not only that; as I said before, the marriage of
a lady of high rank and noble family with a leader of
insurgent Jews is a matter of national importance.
Your father has agreed with me that such is the case.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the word “insurgent” Montella started forward
as though he wished to speak, but his sweetheart, with
a gesture, restrained him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Jews are not insurgents,” she corrected quietly.
“It is you and your party who are endeavouring to
make them so. I think it a pity that the nation has
not enough to do to look after its own affairs without
troubling about mine. I am afraid I do not
appreciate an interest of this sort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier scowled, and Lord Torrens, noticing
it, advanced.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you to give Mr. Moore a proper answer,
my dear child,” he said amicably. “Since he has
taken the trouble to come here expressly on your
account, it is fitting that you should make your
defence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Defence?” repeated the girl, with rising colour.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Am I in a court of law?” She gulped down her
angry feelings, and added, in a quieter tone: “Very
well, Mr. Moore, my defence is simply this: If I
am of noble birth, Mr. Montella’s lineage is more
ancient than my own, and there is no member of my
family who has ever done so much to promote the
general welfare of his country as did the late Sir
Julian Montella for England. Lionel himself is in
every way worthy of respect; and the brilliance of
his university and parliamentary careers has proved
that a more gifted man of his age cannot be found.
That he is a Jew is to me an additional attraction,
and for the senseless opinions of society at large I
care nothing whatever. In regard to the religious
point of view, I feel justified in seceding from
Christianity if the circumstances necessitate my doing
so. Perhaps had I received a more careful religious
training, I might not have found it so easy to renounce,
but since my mother died I have been left to flounder
about in the maze of conflicting and contradictory
doctrines; consequently I have nothing to cling to, and
no treasured sentiment to forego. Finally, I love
Mr. Montella with all my heart, and therefore I am
determined to be faithful to my promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gave a sigh of relief as her voice dropped into
silence. Her listeners could not help admiring the
staunch spirit of her words. Lionel hated to be
eulogised, but his heart warmed towards his sweet
and zealous advocate. The Premier realised the
futility of his intervention, but he was not yet
willing to throw up the sponge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see that to discuss the matter with you is
useless,” he returned, with equanimity. “It is seldom
possible to argue with a woman, I find. However, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>now make my appeal to your father. Lord Torrens,
you have heard my opinion both as politician and
friend, and I hope you now realise the importance
and truth of what I have said. It is your duty to
prohibit this marriage by every means in your power;
but if you do not feel disposed to exert your prerogative,
will you accept me as deputy in your
place? Do you give me the authority to work for
you in this matter? If so, I think I shall be able to
find—by means of the law—an impediment which
cannot be surmounted. If I undertake to fight out
the matter, the marriage <em>shall not take place</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He jerked out the last words as though he were
pronouncing final judgment, and brought his fist
down on the table with force. The lovers looked at
each other, and Montella made as though he would
speak; but again Patricia restrained him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Father,” she said, approaching the Earl, with a
look of appeal, “do you not think this interview has
lasted long enough?  I have listened to Mr. Moore
with all the patience I could manage; but when he
threatens to prevent my marriage by means of the
law, it is like trying to frighten a child. We may
not know much—Lionel and I—but we are wise
enough to know that the law has no power where
we are concerned. Besides, you would not give Mr.
Moore permission to act for you in this matter, would
you, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl was getting impatient, and took no notice
of her caress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I give Mr. Moore permission to do as he likes,”
he answered, a trifle pettishly. “If the matter is of
national importance, it is in his domain, and he can
take what steps he chooses. Personally, I like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Montella, and have no objection to him as a son-in-law.
You must fight it out between you; I wash
my hands of the whole affair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two young people looked triumphant, but so
did the Premier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it is unnecessary to prolong this interview
further,” he said, taking up his hat and stick. “Since
you give me authority, Lord Torrens, I shall know
what course to pursue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella at last came forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One moment, Mr. Moore, before you go,” he put
in, drawing his beloved towards him. “Lady Patricia
and I have no wish to maintain a personal enmity
towards you, and we should like to part as friends.
It may be that we shall never cross your path again,
for when the barbarous Edict is published, it is
probable that we shall leave England for good.
Meanwhile, we may assure you that whatever steps
you may take to prevent our marriage will be
absolutely useless, for the simple reason that—in
order to save further controversy on the matter—<em>we
were married this morning</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had no occasion to repeat his statement; his
words carried conviction with them. The Earl
started in surprise, and then gave vent to a chuckle
of amusement. The Premier was quite taken aback,
but in spite of the sudden pallor which overspread
his face, he managed to retain his self-possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since you have taken the law into your own
hands, then there is no more to be said,” he returned,
in a voice from which all the bombast had departed.
“May I ask where the ceremony was performed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The bridegroom produced sundry documents from
his breast pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“We were married first at the registrar’s office at
Knightsbridge, then by the Chief Rabbi in my
mother’s drawing-room. If you wish to see the
certificate you are welcome to do so,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier condescended to give the papers his
examination. Then he suddenly veered round, and
astonished them all by offering his congratulations.
The newly-married pair were too happy to bear
malice, and accepted them with satisfaction. But
they could not help remarking on his sudden change
of feeling when the Premier eventually took his leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl chuckled for the remainder of the day,
and in his admiration for Montella’s smartness,
forbore to be angry. He considered that the interfering
Premier had been nicely fooled, and expressed
the hope that the lesson would do him good.
Montella wondered what Moore’s next move would
be; he knew that he was not the man to swallow
defeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a strange wedding-day, dearest!” he
exclaimed on the drive towards his mother’s flat—their
temporary home. “We could not have been
married in a quieter manner had we been the poorest
couple in England. Why, even our footman had his
wedding-breakfast, and a fortnight at Southend; but
we have had to dispense both with festivities and
honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia smiled up at him reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, Lal, we will make up for it later on,”
she returned happily. “It is Parliament’s fault, and
you are still in mourning, you know. There will be
plenty of time for our honeymoon when the Edict is
proclaimed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There will be hardships for us both,” he said, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>a sigh, his brow clouding. “I quail when I think of
what I have brought upon you, my beloved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She drove away his forebodings with a gentle
caress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can bear all hardships and all troubles,” she
answered, in an eager voice. “I can undergo anything—so
long as I have you!”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII<br /> MONTELLA’S OLD NURSE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Montella-Byrne alliance evoked no little comment
in society and the Press, and it was tacitly
agreed that Lady Patricia should be socially
punished for her offence. Nevertheless, friends
sprang up in defence of the newly-married pair from
the most unexpected quarters, and Patricia found
that she was not to lose all her Christian acquaintance
after all. When Parliament adjourned for the
Christmas recess, she and her husband travelled to a
village near Thorpe Burstall, in the vicinity of which
was situated the Montellas’ country seat. They
arrived there at noon on Christmas Eve, and to their
complete surprise, received an ovation at the railway
station. The villagers, too loyal to be affected by the
anti-Jewish agitation, remembered only the never-failing
kindness they had received at the hands of the
late Sir Julian Montella, and turned out in full force
to welcome his son’s bride. Between the station and
Burstall Abbey two arches of welcome had been
erected, and although the quantity of highly-coloured
paper with which they were adorned conduced to a
somewhat crude effect, to the happy pair they were
not lacking in beauty. When the second was
reached, four stalwart men insisted on taking the
horses out of the carriage, and themselves dragged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the vehicle to its destination. Surely there could be
no greater honour than this!</p>

<p class='c009'>Amidst the joyous sound of cheering they alighted
and entered the house. Montella’s heart was so full
that he could scarcely find words in which to frame
his thanks. The devotion of the people, coming at a
time when he had had nothing but unfavourable
criticism on all sides, could not fail to touch him
deeply. It showed him that the burning fever of
anti-Semitism had at least not been permitted to
penetrate here, and that it was still possible to show
good feeling towards a Jew. He reciprocated by
inviting them to dinner in the large hall on New
Year’s Day, an invitation which, needless to say, was
unanimously accepted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Burstall Abbey—which was built in the Gothic
style—had come into the Montellas’ possession in
1870. It was a fine old place, and Sir Julian had
taken pride in seeing that it was kept in good repair.
There had been two chapels attached, the first of
which had fallen into decay many years ago. The
second had been transformed into a dining-room, and
was one of the finest apartments in the house. The
altar had long since been done away with, and its
place was now occupied by a massive chiffonier; but
the oak wainscot and mullioned windows remained,
as well as the high-pointed arches and lofty roof.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would the old monks say if they could see
us enjoying our lunch here?” remarked Patricia
laughingly, as she sat down to the table. “They
would call us vandals and barbarians, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was so delighted with everything in the place,
that Lionel was all the more grieved that the
property would so soon pass out of his hands. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>seemed such a great pity to have to give up the
Abbey, where both he and his father had been born.
There were so many tender memories and associations
of his childhood connected with it, that it would be
like renouncing part of his own personality. But
when the Edict was proclaimed there would be no
other alternative; and sell it he must.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish my father would take it over,” Patricia
said eagerly, when they had discussed the question
several times. “We can ask him to hold it in trust
for us; some day we may be able to have it back
again. Shall I write to him about it, Lionel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you like, dear; but there is no immediate
hurry. You are more hopeful than I am,” he added
half sorrowfully. “Some day to me means no day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia looked up quickly and noticed the little
furrow on his brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not like you to be despondent, Lal,” she
said, with a touch of reproach. “You have worried
too much, and eaten too little of late I think. I
want you to promise me not to give another thought
to the Jews whilst we are down here. Let us be
happy as long as we can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had she been less unselfish, the girl would have
been jealous of the subject which engrossed so much
of her husband’s attention; but she was so anxious
to be his helpmate as well as his wife, that she concentrated
her own interest on the same question.
She knew that when the call to action came he was
the man of all men to be inspired with hope, and to
press on towards the end he had in view. It was the
forced inaction—the waiting for events—which proved
such a strain to his mental system, and it was for
this reason that she sought to divert his thoughts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>elsewhere. She encouraged him to go out as much
as possible, and scoured the surrounding country
with him in his motor. There were also his
numerous cottages to be inspected and his favourite
tenants to be visited, for Montella was not only
landlord, but friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was while they were on their peregrinations
through the village that they came across one Anne
Whiteside, who had once been Lionel’s nurse. They
happened to meet her just outside her own dwelling,
and she insisted on their entering to partake of tea.
The Montellas, nothing loath, stepped into her little
parlour, and settled themselves comfortably on the
stiff horse-hair sofa. It was a pleasant little room in
spite of its plainness, and everything in it was
scrupulously clean. There was an old-fashioned
piano which had probably not been opened for
years, and a still more old-fashioned cabinet. The
table—round in shape—was covered by an elaborately
worked cloth, upon whose surface rested a
number of books, including a huge Family Bible.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old dame took such evident pleasure in preparing
the tea, that the visitors felt no compunction
in giving her the trouble. She toasted the cakes in
the kitchen, but popped into the parlour every few
minutes, fork in hand, to assure them that she would
not be long. When all was ready, she donned her
best widow’s cap, and took her seat at the head of
the table. Then Montella inquired after Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Tom’s well enough,” she replied, with affability.
“He’s grown mightily since you saw him
last, Master Linie, only his poor brain seems to
stand still. He is sitting in his corner of the kitchen,
looking at a picture-book the lady up at the lodge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>has given him. He’s mighty fond of pictures, is my
Tom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The “Master Linie” caused a smile to flit across
Patricia’s face, and immediately she called up the
vision of her husband as a child in frocks and
pinafores.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Tom your little grandson?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old nurse nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; leastways, he isn’t a little boy, for he will
be fifteen next March, and he’s an orphan, poor lad!
Perhaps you would like to see him, my lady, after
tea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia answered in the affirmative, and proceeded
to attack a somewhat substantial toasted bun. She
knew that if she did not do justice to the tea, Mrs.
Whiteside would feel aggrieved, so she strove courageously
to demolish her share of the feast. Her duty
fulfilled, she followed her kindly hostess to the
kitchen, where the shining cleanliness of the stove
and culinary utensils excited her admiration. In a
corner by the window sat the afflicted boy. Patricia
went over to him, and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was small for his age, but he had a large and
peculiarly-shaped head. His abnormally developed
forehead contrasted almost grotesquely with the
receding chin, and his small nose was out of proportion
with both. His eyes were large, and
surmounted by heavy lids, but there was little
intelligence in their depths. They roamed shiftily
from one object to another, never concentrating their
gaze on anything for more than two or three seconds
at a time. His mouth was large and weak, and he
was unable to close it with firmness. Moreover, he
was afflicted by an impediment in his speech, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>added to the difficulty he experienced in making
himself understood. To strangers, it was hard to
understand the purpose of the poor lad’s existence,
for to the end of his life he could be nothing but a
useless burden. But his grandmother loved him, and
never considered him a load of care. Since her
husband’s death, she had saved and pinched in order
to put by enough to keep the boy when she was gone.
It was nothing to her that he could not understand
and appreciate her self-denial; all the wealth of her
affection was lavished on the lad. He took no notice
of Patricia’s outstretched hand, but glanced at her
out of the corner of his eyes, whilst Mrs. Whiteside
coaxed him to say “How do you do?” to the lady.
Montella’s deep voice seemed to attract his attention
more than Patricia’s gentle tones, and an expression
which was almost intelligent passed over his countenance
as he gazed steadily for a moment at the
stalwart figure of the man. Montella noticed it, and
smiled back encouragingly, but he could not persuade
the boy to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think he has improved at all?” he
inquired of the grandmother, whose face beamed with
pride. “I suppose he is not able to go to school?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; I couldn’t bear to trust him out of my
sight, and to think that the other boys might make
game of him. Besides, he could not learn anything,
poor lamb. There will be time enough for him to
learn when he has put off this mortal flesh, and
received his incorruptible inheritance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke so cheerfully that Lionel was puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean when he has finished with this
life?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“That thought is my greatest comfort, Master
Linie,” she replied. “You see, if poor Tom cannot
do any work in the world by reason of his poor weak
brain, he cannot commit sins either. I would far
rather have him as he is than see him grow up to
drink and gamble like Widow Robson’s son next door.
And I know that the Lord will make up to him in
the next world for all he has missed in this; so you
see that it will all come right in the end, after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What faith you have!” exclaimed Patricia, in
admiration. “I suppose that you would have him
cured if you could, all the same?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, my lady; I would travel to the other
side of the earth if I thought that I should find an
infallible cure at the end of the journey; but as the
doctors have assured me over and over again that
nothing can be done for the boy, I am resigned to
the inevitable. As long as the Lord spares him to
me I shall never complain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your resignation is exemplary, nurse,” said
Montella, as they returned to the little parlour; and
then Patricia having refastened her jacket, they took
their leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>They saw more of Mrs. Whiteside, however, before
they went back to town. She had heard something
of the anticipated Edict, and desired full information
on the subject. Leaving Tom in the charge of a
neighbour, she came up to the Abbey one morning,
dressed in her best. The Montellas were in the
library discussing a letter they had received from
Dr. Engelmacher. The news was good, insomuch
as building operations on the portion of land between
Haifa and Akka, stretching to the Sea of Galilee,
had now commenced.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Haifa will be our capital for the present,” the
great leader wrote, after he had given vent to his
jubilant feelings. “There is a fairly good harbour
here, except when the wind is in the north-west.
The town seems more capable of improvement and
extension than any other on the coast of Palestine,
and there is already a Jewish colony near by. By
the time you and your charming wife come out, my
dear Montella, your place of residence will be ready
for your occupation. Picture to yourself a magnificent
white-painted, flat-roofed house situated amidst
olive-trees, with Mount Carmel to look down upon
you, and hill after hill as far as eye can reach. Why,
you will wonder how you could have remained in
prosaic London for so many months at a time. And
the thought that we are no longer on sufferance, but
that this is our own country—our own little republic—will
be best of all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not lacking in enthusiasm, this big, burly,
and usually matter-of-fact doctor. His letter
brimmed over with expressions of cheery optimism,
and he refused to be disheartened by those who
opposed his schemes. What mattered the growlings
of France and Russia so long as Turkey could be
conciliated by <em>backsheesh</em>? Once the Palestinian
negotiations were concluded and the treaty signed,
he was certain his people need have no fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella put the letter away as Mrs. Whiteside was
shown into the room. To the old nurse every chair
in the place was familiar, and she entered with the air
of one who knew her way about. She remained
standing, however, and refused to be seated. She
did not wish to detain Master Linie and her ladyship;
she had only come to make a request. Lionel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>expressed his willingness to grant it whatever it might
be. He thought she might want to change her
abode, or to have some improvements made to the
cottage, or something of a like nature. He was
always ready to meet the wishes of his tenants,
including this one, in spite of the fact that she lived
rent free. But Mrs. Whiteside’s desire lay in another
direction altogether; she was quite satisfied with the
present condition of her house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it true that if Parliament persecutes the Lord’s
ancient people you will go and live in the Holy
Land?” she asked, in her quaint way. “Mr. Bell,
the policeman, said you might; but I said you would
never leave Burstall Abbey for good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be a case of needs must, I am afraid,
Anne,” Montella replied, noticing the look of concern
on her face. “If it comes to being false to Judaism
or leaving the country, Lady Patricia and I will have
to go. But I will not sell the Abbey except to some
good and responsible man, and you need have no
fear that you will suffer by the change. Your house
belongs to you, nurse, and no one shall rob you of it.
I will tell my solicitor to prepare a document to that
effect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The dame’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I wasn’t thinking of that, Mr. Linie,” she
said quickly, with a touch of reproach. “Only it will
nearly break my heart to see strangers in the old
place. It was your grandfather who first got me a
situation down here, and I’ve been here ever since.
I remember every birth, marriage, and death in the
family, and I’ve just counted time by those
events.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have always been a faithful retainer, nurse,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>he rejoined kindly. “It is gratifying to know that
our departure will be regretted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, it will be regretted by every man, woman,
and child in the place, but by me most of all. Mr.
Linie, will you do me a favour—the greatest I’ve ever
asked of you? Will you take me and my boy with
you when you go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was out at last, and the old woman’s form
quivered with excitement. If he were to refuse, it
would be the greatest disappointment she had ever
received. She was so devoted to the very name of
Montella that she could not bear to be left behind.
She watched Lionel’s face as she put the question, and
awaited his answer in an agony of suspense. Lady
Patricia drew forward a chair, and made her sit down.
She could see that the nurse was intensely moved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We intend dismissing our staff of servants both in
London and down here if we go,” the young man
replied thoughtfully. “We shall be expected to
employ Jewish labour as much as possible in the
new land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will have to employ some Gentile
servants to work for you on your Sunday, sir,” she
interposed eagerly. “I could see to that for you, and
I could do all sorts of odd jobs for your lady and
Lady Montella. I am getting old, maybe, but I can get
about just as well as ever I could. I am sure you could
manage the matter, Mr. Linie, if you were to try.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The pleading in her manner touched Patricia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say yes, Lionel,” she said to her husband, in a
quiet voice. “As Mrs. Whiteside seems so anxious to
accompany us, it would be a pity not to take her
with us if we go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“The Queen hath spoken: so be it,” he returned
lightly. “Very well, nurse, I will promise you this.
If we go, you shall go with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Tom, too, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, certainly. We should not think of parting
you from your boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old nurse was not effusive in her gratitude, but
her eyes shone as she thanked them and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe that woman would be faithful to the
death,” Lionel said, as the door closed behind her.
He felt that it was good to be the possessor of such
loyal allegiance.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> A DIFFICULT ALTERNATIVE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Jews’ Expulsion Bill had been passed through
the House of Lords at last, but the Act would not be
put into full force until the April of the next year.
The fourteen months’ grace was given for charity’s
sake, in order that those Jews who came under the
ban might have time to settle up their affairs. This
was certainly an improvement on the Expulsion of
1290, when the Jews were deprived of all they
possessed, and cast adrift in such a manner that
many of them succumbed before reaching the other
side of the Channel. Nevertheless, Athelstan Moore
and his party had taken care to impose certain
restrictions, so that the interim would not be entirely
a respite. The immigration of aliens from abroad,
whether <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for other countries or not, was
immediately stopped, no foreign Jew of whatever
status being allowed to land. No Jew was allowed
to rent or purchase any new property, and the
money-lending business was brought to an abrupt
standstill. Jewish marriages were forbidden, and all
Jews holding civic positions were deprived of office.
Besides all this, there were numerous rules and
regulations of lesser importance, so that the Jew
would find himself hedged in on every side. But
there existed a loophole of escape available to all;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>it was nothing to the Government that it would be
accepted only by the few.</p>

<p class='c009'>This loophole consisted of a certificate of assimilation
granted by every local magistrate on certain
conditions. Any Jew or Jewess over the age of
fifteen was eligible as a candidate, and children could
be signed for by their parents. In order to obtain it,
certain statements had to be declared on oath in the
presence of a commissioner and three witnesses, and
once the oath was taken, the penalty for breaking it
would be extremely severe. The conditions were
embodied in the following form of declaration:</p>

<p class='c016'>“I&#160;............ hereby declare that I am a Jew (or Jewess)
by birth only, and not by religion; that I totally renounce
Judaism, and everything connected therewith; that I will
mix freely with Gentiles, and do my best to dispel all
clannishness and cliquism of race.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I further undertake to make the Christian Sunday my
day of rest, and to celebrate socially the great Christian
festivals; also to partake of ordinary Gentile food, and to
cease to observe the Jewish dietary laws; to refrain from
speaking or reading Hebrew, and from the use of Jewish
idioms. I promise to abstain from every Jewish rite, to
attend either a Christian, Theistic, or Unitarian place of
worship, and to associate myself religiously and socially
with either of these three bodies.</p>

<p class='c016'>(If eligible for marriage.) “I undertake to marry one of
Gentile birth only, and to bring up any children of the said
union in the faith of their Gentile parent.</p>

<p class='c016'>(If already married.) “I undertake to teach all my
children, both now and in the future, the religion of the
Church (Christian, Theistic, or Unitarian) I intend to make
my own.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(Signed)&#160;.....................”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Here was to follow the full name address, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>description of the candidate, with photograph
attached.</p>

<p class='c009'>This certificate was granted only to those who
were already British subjects either by birth or by
naturalisation of five years’ standing. No “greener”
was therefore eligible, and foreign labour in Whitechapel
was thereby done away with. The formula
had been drawn up by Mr. Lawson Holmes, M.P.,
the ardent advocate of assimilation in its most
thorough form. To him it seemed fair and just, and
the only means of refining the Jewish element of the
English nation to its due proportion. He considered
that from the point of view of utilitarianism, mere
sentiment must be put aside. He was not an anti-Semite,
and he disagreed on many points with the
Premier; he was undoubtedly a man of sound
common sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>As was to be expected, however, his formula
evoked a storm of indignation in the Jewish press.
Eloquent appeals to the patriotism of the race were
issued and disseminated amongst the British Jews
throughout the land, and meetings of protest were
held despite the vigilance of the police. What
People—were they ever so irresponsible—would
renounce their race and religion, together with their
ancient and illustrious past, at the mere word of
command? The very thought of persecution was
enough to make men cling to their cherished
traditions with a new and greater strength. Such a
result—the deepening of their peculiar unity—had
been proved in the annals of history over and over
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall go and see Holmes to-night,” Montella
said to his wife, as soon as he had received notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of the formula. “I cannot rest until I have made
him see the absurdity of the whole thing. He used
to be a friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask him what would be his answer if he were
commanded to give up his birthright as a freeborn
English Christian,” advised his mother, with heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But don’t make matters worse by quarrelling with
him, dear,” added Patricia gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella promised to use his discretion; he was
not of a fiery temperament. He met Mr. Lawson
Holmes in the lobby of the House of Commons, and
adjourned with him to his club. His friend insisted
on dining first before entering on the subject, and
Lionel consented to partake of a vegetarian repast.
It was when they lingered over their wine that the
Cabinet Minister began his defence. He could not
help being impressed in spite of himself by Lionel’s
reproachful mien.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear fellow, let us survey the question
from an economic standpoint,” he began, as he puffed
away at a cigar. “I shall proceed to dissect you
metaphorically, if you have no objection?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None at all, so long as you leave the ego—that
which is my real self—intact,” Lionel replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then, let us begin.” The Minister
removed his cigar from his lips, and placed it between
his fingers. “First of all, I take it that you are one
of the units of which the English nation is composed:
that you are by birth and education an Englishman,
and a subject of the King?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella acquiesced.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That being so, then, your tastes are naturally
British, and your interest is to a great degree monopolised
by the country of your birth. This is proved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>by the mere fact of your being an ex-member of
Parliament, in which capacity I know you desired to
exercise your influence for the national good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet when you are told that a certain legislation
concerning the question of the Jews is for the national
good, you steadfastly set your face against it, and
resent its introduction. Being hemmed in by the
narrowness of your creed, you are unable to get outside
yourself, so to speak, and look at the matter from a
rational and utilitarian point of view. That is the
great difference between you and your parliamentary
colleagues.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly,” put in Montella eagerly. “I am a
Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Jew, yes; but I wish to discover how much of
the Jew there is in you—the real Jew, according to
the Oriental sense of the term. That there is an
element of Hebraism in your moral and intellectual
nature I do not dispute; but there are other and Occidental
elements which you have inherited to a greater
degree. Do you think your forefathers, when they
left Palestine and lived in the West, were not affected
by the influences of Hellenism, of Chivalry, of the
Renaissance, of the Reformation, and of the Christian
ethics in general, with which they came into contact?
My dear fellow, the Occidental Jew—such as yourself—is
no more like the Hebrew of old than I am! Do
you think that if you were forced to live in strict
accordance with the Talmudic law, you would feel
that you were fulfilling the obligations of your race?
I assure you that you would feel nothing of the kind;
you would know that you were returning to darkness,
shutting out civilisation and light.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Perhaps so,” replied the young man thoughtfully,
“but for all that, I am a Jew, and not all the
Occidental influences in the world have been able to
break the bond which unites me to my forefathers.
Blood is thicker than water, Mr. Holmes; and when
once the blood of an Israelite flows in a man’s veins,
it is impossible for him to forget his heritage. He
may renounce it as he likes, but by his looks, his
temperament, his associations, his very tricks of
gesture, he betrays it. That I have nothing in
common with the typical Jew of tradition, and that I
am a thorough Englishman at heart I am glad to
admit; nevertheless there is a difference between
myself and you, for instance. Small and indefinable
though it may be, you know that it is there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had drawn his chair back from the table in his
ardour, and leant back with a flush on his brow. His
dark eyes glowed with the intensity of feeling, and
about the youthful, clean-shaven face, with its
splendid forehead, sensitive nostrils, and firm, yet
gentle mouth, there was a nobility which it was hard
to resist. Holmes secretly considered Montella a
perfect specimen of his race, but he was loath to
believe that he had inherited a single good quality
from his Hebrew ancestors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As long as you remain an idealist, my dear boy,
you will never be able to take a dispassionate view
of the matter,” he returned, with deliberation. “It is
that sentimental clinging to tradition which is your
people’s bane. My standpoint, however, is simply
this: A Jewish element in a nation is a desirable and
almost an essential thing to have, but as soon as that
element preponderates—as now—it becomes a danger
to the State. Therefore it must be kept within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>bounds, and those Jews who refuse to conform to the
customs of this country must be weeded out. The
only way out of the present crisis, it seems to me, is
absorption, for as long as you Jews remain separatists
you have no right to the full privileges of the land
of your adoption. Therefore the Government has
thought fit to take stringent measures to bring
about this result; and although I admit that those
measures seem unnecessarily harsh, I know that they
are for the benefit of the nation at large. Let those
Jews who cherish the scriptural tradition and maintain
their clannishness return to the land of their fathers.
There must be either assimilation or a separate
Jewish state.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you think this justifies the persecution of
two hundred and seventy thousand people, the
majority of whom are loyal subjects of the
King?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Minister frowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not call it persecution when the alternative
is such a reasonable one,” he replied. “It is not as if
we were compelling you to become Christians. You
can retain your religious belief in the Absolute Unity
by declaring yourselves Theists or Monotheists
instead of Jews; the change is only in the name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we are to give up our customs and our
Sabbath, our fasts and our feasts, and everything
which throughout the centuries has made Judaism
the bond of union twixt Jew and Jew!” He sighed,
knowing that they might argue till Doomsday, and
yet remain as far asunder as the poles. Mr. Lawson
Holmes was well informed concerning the Jews,
and indeed possessed more knowledge than the
average Gentile; but he was not capable of putting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>himself in the position of a Jew; he could not
understand the racial claim.</p>

<p class='c009'>In spite of all Jewish obligations and the condemnation
of the press, however, the assimilation
plan was not unanimously rejected by the Jews.
Some were too deaf to the claims of race and faith
to care to retain them; others were less insensible,
but could not bear the thought of suffering; others,
again, were prepared to sacrifice their personal
feelings for the sake of the public good. It was one
thing to cherish one’s old traditions, and look kindly
on all things Jewish for old association’s sake; it was
quite another thing to have to pay for the privilege
of doing so by expulsion, physical discomfort, money,
and loss of pride. It was found that the majority of
those Jews who had long mixed with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span></i> of
English society, including some of the princes of
finance, were quite willing to take the oath; but the
number of faithful Jews increased as one descended
the social scale. It is ever so when a religious or
moral upheaval affects the heart of a people; for a
passionate and public adherence to a religious or
moral belief one has to look amongst the poor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Montellas were a notable exception amongst
their prosperous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</span></i>. The loyal faith and
inherent sense of duty possessed by Lady Montella
were shared by her son, and to him the rest of their
co-religionists looked for help. Young as he was, he
possessed all the characteristics which conduce to
the making of a good leader, and in his devotion to
the cause he made a worthy protector of his people’s
interests. It was good to know that amidst the
trouble and confusion of this terrible crisis there
was a man in Israel on whom one could depend—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>man who possessed the power of wealth and influence
as well as that of intellectual attainments, whose very
personality inspired confidence in the souls of the
depressed, whose heart was in truth a heart of gold.
Encouraged by the resolute faith of his mother, and
influenced by the beautiful disposition of his wife,
his character expanded in breadth without losing its
manliness. Difficulties which would have filled
others with alarm, were to him as so many easily
surmounted obstacles to be overcome. With a
clearness of vision, granted only to the few, he was
able to look onward in the future, seeing not the
immediate distress of present circumstances, but only
the coming glory of that Eastern Land.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER I<br /> PURIM IN HAIFA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Haifa, the most modern city in Palestine, lay at the
southern point of the Bay of Acre, about fifty miles
north of Jaffa. Situated amid palm-trees, it retained
its Eastern character whilst bearing witness to the
innovations of the West. During the two years
which had elapsed since the English Edict of
Expulsion, the great army of Jewish artisans had
laboured well. Rows upon rows of white bungalows
had sprung up almost, as it seemed, in a night; and
although they could not boast of the substantiality
of their construction, they could be improved by
degrees. The greater part of the population consisted
of British refugees, who, linked together by
the same home ties, concentrated themselves as much
as possible in one quarter, leaving their brethren of
other nationalities to settle in different parts of the
country. Therefore, although it was an accepted
rule that Hebrew was to be learnt and spoken, they
instinctively clung to their native tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were very aristocratic, these exiled English
Jews. Like many English people who travel abroad,
they considered themselves vastly superior to all the
foreigners with whom they came into contact. They
looked down on their poor Polish and Roumanian
brethren, who in their turn considered the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>as irreligious moderns, scarcely worthy of the name of
Jews. The brotherly feeling of equality which their
leaders endeavoured to instil within them was as yet
entirely lacking. Although of identical race and
religion, and gathered together under one banner,
the distinctions of class and nationality held them
aloof.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the eve of Purim, the Feast of Lots. By
decree of the council, a public holiday had been proclaimed;
for it was intended that this day should
annually be observed, and that the rejoicings should
be akin to the nature of a carnival. It was not until
dusk, however, that the festivities began. The day
had been unusually hot, even for Syria, and the
majority of the inhabitants had chosen to spend the
holiday indoors. At sunset came the breeze, and the
heat of the day was replaced by a refreshing and
welcome coolness. No matter how hot the day in
Haifa, the nights were always cool.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a sequestered corner of a city roof-garden were
Lionel Montella and his wife. Above them the
moon shone with dazzling splendour, making the
numberless hills stand out as sentinels on guard, and
causing the waters of the bay to sparkle like myriads
of jewels. Patricia reclined against the cushions of
her chair, and inhaled the fragrance of the breeze with
keen enjoyment. She found the Syrian climate so
trying that she was thankful for every breath of air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two years in Palestine had changed her little,
and she was still a delicately fair and beautiful girl.
Devotedly attached to her husband and baby boy,
she found no occasion to pine for her friends in the
West. She had always possessed the power of
adapting herself to her surroundings, and she soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>became accustomed to the strangeness of her new
life. Recently the Princess Charles von Felsen-Schvoenig
had arrived to “do” Palestine, and was
at present in Haifa, so that she was not entirely
destitute of friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Princess is late,” she remarked, as Lionel
took a seat at her side. “She said she would come
here to see the fun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps her carriage has some difficulty in getting
through the crowd,” Montella replied. “I am just
wondering if this carnival idea of Engelmacher’s is a
wise one. It means practically setting the people
loose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rather like the idea,” Patricia said thoughtfully.
“The people have had such a serious time of it that
it will do them good to relax for once. I do not see
why they should not behave as well as the people at
Nice or Cannes. The soldiers will keep them within
bounds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can scarcely reconcile myself to the thought of
vociferous Jewish rejoicing,” he rejoined. “We have
sung in the minor key for so many years. Do you
know, dearest, these last two years seem to have
passed like a dream. I have difficulty in convincing
myself sometimes that I am awake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A dream of hard work, then,” was her reply.
“To be governor of a city so cosmopolitan as Haifa,
and where the inhabitants have scarcely settled down,
is no sinecure, Lal, dear. I know of no man, not
excepting Dr. Engelmacher himself, who could have
done so much in so short a time. It is no wonder
that there is already a streak of grey in your hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bent down and kissed her with eyes full of
tenderness. His life in Palestine would have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>almost unbearable without Patricia’s sweet sympathy
and encouragement; for there was much in the city
and the people over whom he was placed that vexed
him sometimes beyond endurance. Her love was the
sustaining power which made the rough places smooth,
and she possessed so winning a manner that she could
exert a greater influence over the people by a single
sentence than he could by a long and forcible address.
Political administration could do much to improve
the conditions of the city, but it could not instil a high
moral tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rustle of silken garments announced the
approach of ladies, and Montella rose from his chair.
The Princess, clad in a gown of filmy white, was
accompanied by Lady Montella and Raie. Just at
that moment the sound of cheering came up to them
from below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My little car has met with the approval of the
people,” the Princess said, smiling. “It is the one I
had in Rome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella went over to the parapet and looked
down. A small white swan-shaped car, drawn by
four Arabian ponies, was being driven slowly away.
It was decorated with choice flowers, and illuminated
with tiny lamps, resulting in a fairy-like effect. In
the procession which would presently set out for
the mock hanging of Haman’s effigy, it would serve
as Queen Esther’s triumphal car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Montella took me over your new house
this afternoon,” the Princess informed Patricia, as she
settled herself at her side. “It will be the show-place
of Haifa. I like your Roman atrium immensely.
Who designed it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lionel. He is so determined that I should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>an artistic home that he has spared no pains to make
it beautiful for me. That is why the builders have
taken so much time over it. For myself, I am quite
happy in this little place, in spite of its plainness. It
was a sort of hospice before we came, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled as she thought of her husband’s
enthusiasm over the house he was having built.
That house was his hobby, and he took the same
pride in it as an artist over his picture. And she
knew the motive of his interest was concentrated in
herself; in his eyes there was no home which could
be beautiful enough for his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must invite me to come and stay with you
when it is finished,” said the Princess lightly.
“Meanwhile I must be content with my exalted
position on the top of Mount Carmel. It is something,
is it not, to stay in the very place where
Elijah conquered the prophets of Baal? I love
Mount Carmel!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You seem quite enamoured of Palestine altogether,”
said Montella, joining the group. “I did not think
you would stay so long, Princess—you who have seen
so much of other countries.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do like Palestine,” she admitted readily. “I
like the Oriental colouring, and it amuses me to note
the curious blending of types and nationalities to be
found here. Besides, Palestine possesses an interest
all its own. I am not religiously inclined myself;
but it is, after all, the <em>Holy Land</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Holy Land!” repeated Patricia musingly.
“Do you know of what the phrase puts me in
remembrance? Why, of the dreaded Scripture
lessons I had in the days of my childhood. My
governess used to make me learn the exact position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of every place mentioned in the Bible, until I could
almost find them, blindfolded, on the map. I am
afraid I used to hate the Holy Land in those days.
I never dreamt that I should go there myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you like it better now that you are
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but I should like any place for so long as
my husband were with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She glanced affectionately at Lionel. The Princess
sighed. Perhaps a pang of compunction smote her
for having left her own husband to lead a solitary life
in the castle at Felsen-Schvoenig. Hers was a
curious blending of character which the German
Prince could not understand. She was alternately
defiant and yielding; unfortunately, whenever she
came into contact with her husband, the defiance
predominated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-day’s mail brought me a letter from Mamie,”
she said, after a moment’s silence. “She seems to be
getting on very well with her new husband, considering
Moore’s temper. She says that he is more interesting
than Chesterwood, because she never knows
what sort of a mood he will be in next. There is
something in that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How does she like being the Prime Minister’s
wife?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Athelstan is horrid in that way,” the Princess
replied vaguely. “He doesn’t believe in women
meddling with politics; and won’t tell her any State
secrets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sensible man!” remarked Montella, with a
playful glance at his wife; and then the cheering
having begun anew, he returned to the parapet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“The procession is coming,” announced Raie, who
was looking down on the crowd. “Look: ‘<em>What
shall be done to the man whom the King delighteth to
honour?</em>’ There is the Scroll of Esther. I suppose
they are going to the synagogue to read it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The procession was headed by the students of the
new Haifa Jews’ College in full dress, and was
unenlivened by the strains of any brass band.
Instead, the weird chanting of Psalms in Hebrew
smote the air, the voices sounding clear, but somewhat
harsh. Men of all sorts and conditions followed
on: the swarthy Pole walked side by side with the
ruddy Saxon, the fair and slender Jerusalemite with
the wiry Roumanian. Coming from a source so
heterogeneous, they were yet able to sink their
national differences on one common meeting-ground;
and Hebrew, that sacred tongue of their fathers,
served as a language for them all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella, with her arm within her son’s,
watched them with swelling heart. To her, there
was a deeper significance than the mere joy of Purim
in the procession of rejoicing Jews. The chord of
racial nationalism which lay so far down in her nature
responded as to an harmonious touch, and quivered
with an emotion which could scarcely be expressed
in words. Years ago she had dreamt of a free
gathering under the sign of the Shield of David. It
seemed as if her dream had at last come true.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I go down amongst the crowd, Aunt Inez?”
asked Raie, breaking in upon her reverie. “I want
to have a look at all the funny things the men are
selling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would not be safe, dear,” Lady Montella replied.
“You would need a stronger escort than Anne.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“You can come with me presently, Raie,” volunteered
the Princess, noticing the girl’s air of
disappointment “If Lady Montella has no objection,
you shall spend the night with me at the Mount
Carmel Hotel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie was delighted, and having obtained permission,
went to get ready forthwith. An hour
later they were being driven through the densely
thronged streets. The festivities had taken a more
hilarious turn, but there was nothing riotous in the
behaviour of any of the people. When the Jew
rejoices as a religious duty, he does it with his whole
heart; but as he is not addicted to drink, he is able
to keep his merriment within bounds. The throwing
of the modern confetti and the trampling underfoot
of Haman’s effigies constituted the chief source of
amusement. Indoors the better-class families were
celebrating the occasion by a grand Purim feast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arrived at the summit of the mount, they found
the hotel in a state of confusion. A tourist—arrived
only that day—had been attacked by an Arab in
one of the caves, and—it was said—lay in a critical
condition. It was the first time for many years that
an outrage had been committed so near the town.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess was much concerned, for she had
made the acquaintance of the tourist in question
immediately after his arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His name is Frank Merryweather, and he comes
from Australia,” she said to Raie, who was always
anxious for information. “He is one of the finest
men I have ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is not a Jew?” affirmed the girl, with
interrogation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not sure. He is the sort of man one can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>easily place; but as he spoke of going on to England
shortly, I suppose he is not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Later in the evening, the physician, who happened
to be staying in the hotel, informed them that his
patient’s wound was not so serious as had been
feared. The next morning the patient himself was
brought up to the roof-garden to enjoy the air before
the heat of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess and her friend were up early, and
found him propped up on a couch beneath a shady
palm. The air was fragrant with the breath of
tropical flowers, and was made melodious by the
sweet carolling of the birds. The sick man lay with
his eyes closed, but he opened them as he heard the
rustling of a woman’s dress. His glance first fell on
the stately figure of the Princess, and his features
relaxed in greeting. Then he looked at Raie, who,
in a simple linen gown which suited her well, might
have stood for a picture of perfect girlhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Emanuel, Mr. Merryweather,” said the
Princess; and Raie shook hands with a new tinge of
colour in her cheeks. Then an almost involuntary
look passed between them—the intuitive sign when
Jew meets Jew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were distressed to hear of your accident last
night,” the Princess said, as they took their seats
beside him. “Do tell us about it. Do you feel
better this morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, thank you,” he replied, in a genial voice.
“It was a mere scratch, which the people chose to
magnify into a serious wound. I shall be as right as
ninepence pretty soon. It was my own fault for
prying where I wasn’t wanted. I got into one of the
caves on the other side of the mount, not knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>that it was the parlour of an Arab gentleman until
he set on me and whipped out a knife. I wouldn’t
have intruded if I had known it was his den. I guess
I’ll keep to the township for the future, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you been long in Syria?” asked the
Princess, when they had both commented on the
adventure. “I suppose you have visited Jerusalem
and the neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He answered in the negative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came from Port Said to Jaffa, and from Jaffa to
here,” he explained. “I am really <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> from
Australia to England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie wondered what business had brought him to
Haifa, but she was too well-bred to ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose England is your home?” she said
gently, thinking that there was no harm in questioning
so far.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no home, Miss Emanuel,” was his prompt
reply. “The world is my home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a touch of sadness in his words, as well
as in his voice. The girl glanced up suddenly, and
meeting the gaze from his deep eyes looked as suddenly
away. She felt instinctively that this was a
man who had been brought into contact with the
rough side of life, but who yet retained his natural
refinement of birth. He interested her strangely, and
so strongly that she longed to find out more about
him. If he were a Jew, how was it that he intended
to go to England? Surely he must be aware of the
expulsion of the Jews?</p>

<p class='c009'>She was so impressed by his personality that she
could not help thinking of him, even after her departure
from the hotel. She visited her people—who
lived in one of the white houses in the suburbs—later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in the day, and could scarcely refrain from
mentioning him to them. She was glad, however,
that she was able to check herself in time, for Mrs.
Emanuel’s badinage was the last thing that she
desired. In talking to her mother, however, a half-forgotten
chord of remembrance was stirred in her
brain—a psychological connection between Mr.
Merryweather and a former conversation. She tried
to fathom it out, but the solution escaped her. One
thing she was certain about: she had seen something
of the tourist before.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> RAIE AND THE TOURIST</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Princess had taken a fancy to Raie. She
admired the girl’s winsome face, with its coronal of
curly hair, and the animation which shone in her dark
eyes. She liked, too, her naïve manner and natural
freshness, for, in spite of her thoughtfulness, Raie was
a child of Nature. In England the two had scarcely
spoken, although they had met several times; but
in Haifa the conditions of life were different, and
the friendship, once begun, soon ripened. Thus it
happened that Raie spent a great part of her time
at the Mount Carmel Hotel, either lunching or dining
with her friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>The air of mystery which pervaded the Australian
tourist still prevailed. He would give a certain
amount of information about himself, but no more;
and concerning his own life he was extremely
reticent. He seldom ventured far into the town, and
had not troubled to call at the Government House.
What attracted him to Haifa, therefore, no one
exactly knew; he had evidently come for a private
purpose of his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the Princess possessed acute powers of
perception. She soon saw that Mr. Merryweather
took pleasure in Raie’s society, and that Raie
reciprocated in like manner. So she set the seal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>her approval on the acquaintance by giving them
opportunities for its further cultivation; and in spite
of her worldly wisdom she did not pause to consider
whether such a friendship were desirable. The tourist
was much older than Raie, and of his connections
nothing was known. Yet she encouraged the girl to
form a liking for him which gradually deepened into
love.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had travelled so much that conversation never
languished for want of subject matter. Raie was
profoundly interested in his graphic accounts of life
in the bush, but she would have preferred to hear him
talk about himself. She did not even know if her
instinctive belief that he belonged to her own race
was correct; for although they had often approached
the subject, he had not yet confessed himself a Jew.
She thought so much of him that she was determined
to find out. It would make all the difference in the
world if he were not a Jew.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was fond of taking excursions in the surrounding
country on horseback, and often remained away
over night. He invited the Princess and Raie to
picnic with him near the ruins of the Castellum
Peregrinorum of the Crusaders one day, and seemed
so bent upon their going, that they did not like to
refuse. They set out at dawn, accompanied by two
other gentlemen who were staying at the hotel, and
three Arab servants. Their way lay along a cultivated
plain between the mountains and the sea, with villages
nestling on the slopes above them, and rocks and
ruins below. The gaudily-dressed peasants gazed
at them with distrust, evidently regarding them as
intruders. Arrived at Athlit, they put up their horses
at a neighbouring khan, and prepared to partake of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>light repast. Their appetites had been sharpened by
the ride.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie felt like a schoolgirl out for a holiday. She
had come out with the express intention of enjoying
herself, and she meant to fulfil it to the letter.
Outside the khan lay a solemn-looking camel;
immediately she made up her mind that she must
have a ride.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arab in charge was a gentle-looking individual,
with somewhat melancholy eyes. He wore both a
tarbûsh and keffiyeh on his head, and his abbâ—or
shawl—fell from his shoulders in graceful folds. He
shrugged his shoulders when Mr. Merryweather’s
servant proffered Raie’s request, and in consideration
of <em>backsheesh</em> allowed her to mount. This was
easier said than done, for when the camel began to
rise from the ground she was nearly thrown over his
head. She clung on, however, with all the tenacity
of which she was capable, and felt as if she had
attained a victory when the animal set off at a
jog-trot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merryweather walked alongside in order to
keep her company, and endeavoured to sustain a
conversation with the Arab on the way. When the
girl declared that the motion gave her a peculiar
sensation, he suggested a halt, and the animal was
brought to a sudden standstill. Raie was not sorry
to dismount, and gave a sigh of relief when her feet
touched the ground. She had no desire to repeat the
experience which had been hers on the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her companion paid the Arab, and sent the camel
back to the khan. Then he drew Raie towards one
of the fine carob-trees which abound in that district,
and bade her rest beneath its shade. She settled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>herself comfortably on a boulder, and he flung
himself down at her side. The opportunity for
which he had sought had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Emanuel,” he said suddenly, “are you
fond of Heine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The question was so unexpected that Raie glanced
at him in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean the German poet?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl waxed thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I admire his genius,” she replied, at length, “but
some of his poems irritate me. He is so apt to
descend from the sublime to the ridiculous, and to
him absolutely nothing is sacred. He has the poet’s
mind without the poet’s soul. What makes you think
of Heine, though, just now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking of a little poem I read of his a long
time ago—‘Life’s Salutations.’ It was about meeting
each other on the highway of life, but having little
time to greet before the postillion gives the starting
signal, and we have to be off again.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘In passing each other we nod and we greet</div>
      <div class='line'>With our handkerchiefs waved from the coaches,</div>
      <div class='line'>We fain would embrace, but our horses are fleet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And speed on, despite all reproaches.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>That seems to apply to our case, does it not? We
have had time to greet each other, but that is all.
The signal has been given for my coach to start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean that you are going away?” Raie
asked, with a sinking at her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>He nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” was his reply. “I have stayed here much
longer than I intended, already. I must be in London
at the beginning of next month.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“You are going to England!” she exclaimed, with
disappointment in her voice. If he were going to
England, he could not be a Jew; and if he were
not a Jew, he could be nothing to her. She glanced
at him with an unspoken question in her eyes,
whilst across her bright face flitted an expression
of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>He captured one of her little sunburnt hands, and
held it between his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are sorry—Raie?” he said, in a quiet voice.
“Tell me the truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I am sorry.” She glanced away, and refused
to meet his gaze. “I can’t help being sorry. You
have been so kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had never felt so near crying in her life, and
yet she could have laughed at her own foolishness.
A mist rose before her eyes, and the mountains in
the distance seemed blurred. She released her hand,
and fumbled for her tiny lace handkerchief. Mr.
Merryweather’s features relaxed into an expression
of gentleness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Raie,” he said, with a tender accent on the name,
“I am going to England, but I am not bound to
stay there. In three months’ time I can be back in
Haifa—that is, if you will give me permission to
come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I?” she exclaimed evasively. “What has it to
do with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything. If I return to Haifa it will only be
for you. Perhaps I have no right to speak to you
like this, dear, but I could not go away without
declaring myself. Raie, look me in the face and tell
me the truth. Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised her chin gently with his two hands, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>brought her face on a level with his own. The girl’s
cheeks grew crimson as she looked back into the
depths of his eyes. She answered not a word, but
he was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do love me,” he said, with conviction. “I
can read the answer in your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment of silence as he relaxed his
hold. The girl was undergoing an inward struggle,
and her heart beat fast. She was wondering what the
Montellas would think of her secret lover, and what
her mother would say. Would they be angry with
her, and consider her conduct underhand? Would
they approve of one who was presumably a Christian
and a wanderer? Would it not be wiser to send him
away before it was too late? In less than a minute
these suggestions crowded in upon her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merryweather seemed to guess her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if you love me enough to trust me,
dear,” he said slowly. “You have a right to want
to know something about the man you intend to
marry, but I cannot tell you all about myself just
yet. I can assure you, though, that I come of a
good family—my father is a baronet; and although
I am over thirty, I am a bachelor, and have never
had a love-affair. More than this I cannot tell you
now, but you shall know everything some day.
Until then, will you be content to take me on trust?
Will you promise to become my wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He spoke in the sharp, disjointed sentences which
were—with him—a sign of deep feeling. Raie looked
up at him almost piteously, and for the moment knew
not how to reply. He was so much older and
stronger than herself that she instinctively felt that
resistance would be useless; besides, she did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>want to resist. But something within urged her not
to be rash, and she felt compelled to listen to her
conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do trust you,” she answered, almost inaudibly,
“but I cannot promise to become your wife. I owe
so much to Lady Montella that I could not—I dare
not—engage myself without her consent. You see I
believe in you because—because I know that you are
good; but in her case it would be so different. I am
sure she would not give her consent to our engagement
unless she were satisfied that you—that you—oh,
I can’t explain, but you know what I mean. And
she is so particular that I am afraid she would never
allow me to marry away from my religion. I suppose
you are—not a Jew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She studied his features as though their contour
would reveal what she sought. He was neither fair
nor dark, and his life in the open had lent a ruggedness
to his countenance which baffled her completely.
Fortunately she was not kept long in suspense.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That objection can be easily dispelled,” he
answered, with a slight touch of colour. “I have
the right to call myself a Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet you are going to England?” she questioned,
not yet satisfied. “And—and—Merryweather
is not a Jewish name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bent down and regarded her steadfastly once
more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you not say you would trust me, Raie?” he
rejoined, with a touch of reproach. “What if, for a
certain grave reason, I have been obliged to change
my name? Listen, child,”—his voice became almost
stern—“I am a Jew; but for many years past I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>made mankind my brethren, the world my country,
and God in Nature my religion. When I was a
youth I was expelled from home and people for a
crime which I never committed, since when I have
lived alone. Recently I have had reason to believe
that by returning to England I may be able to
prove my innocence, and as I have made my
fortune out on the goldfields, I shall have the power
that money can give. I can tell you no more, perhaps
I have told you too much already; but I have made
you a most serious confidence. Surely you can trust
me in return?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her face was full of trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do trust you!” she repeated, with a catch in her
breath; “but what you have told me makes it harder
still. Unless she knows the whole truth, I know
Lady Montella will not consent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She must know nothing for the present. Not a
word of what I have told you must pass your lips.
Raie, my darling, I must insist on this for the sake of
us both. Promise me you will not say anything of
this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She promised—but with reluctance, because she
hated to have a secret from her foster-aunt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you tell me your real name?” she asked
half wistfully. “I do not want to think of you as
‘Frank Merryweather’ if that is only a pseudonym.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must have patience a little longer, dear,” he
rejoined. “I dare not tell you yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She glanced at him with reproach in her eyes, but
forbore to put it into words. He bent down and
kissed her on the forehead, and then assisted her to
rise. They were both silent on the way back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the khan, and Raie, at least, was deep in thought.
Suddenly a flash of light as dazzling as a revelation
burst in upon her mind. She knew now why her
lover’s personality had always seemed so familiar to
her. The son of a Jewish baronet—expelled from
home—fortune made in Australia. It was impossible
that there could exist two such men.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped short in her walk, and faced him with
excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not necessary for you to tell me your name,”
she said hurriedly. “I know it already. I first heard
of you from my mother some months ago, and I
have seen your photograph. You are the son whom
Sir Julian so cruelly disinherited. You are Lionel’s
half-brother—Ferdinand Montella!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> A GIRL IN LOVE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He met her gaze of astonishment with a curious
expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdinand Montella is dead,” he returned slowly,
“or at least he is sleeping. For the present Frank
Merryweather remains to take his place. You are a
clever child, Raie. I did not think you would find
me out so easily.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I seemed, somehow, to know you from the first,”
she said gladly, as they continued their walk. “There
was something about your personality which gave
me the impression of having met you before. I
suppose I never have met you before; but your ways
of looking and speaking are very like your poor
father’s, and of course I knew him well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The adjective arrested his attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do not mean to say that my father is—”
He broke off shortly. “Why did you say ‘poor’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because he is dead.” Then realising her abruptness,
she was filled with compunction. “Oh, I am
so sorry,” she added respectfully. “I ought not to
have told you like that. I made sure that you knew;
it was in all the papers. He died over three years ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tourist’s face grew grave, and unconsciously
hardened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have lived practically away from civilisation
for some time, where no news could reach me,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>rejoined, “but I do not suppose I should have been
sent for, even had it been possible. Sir Julian treated
me very unjustly, Raie, and I find it hard to forget.
Still, he was my father, and loved me when I was a
child. I am sorry he has died believing me guilty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie was silent for a few moments, and left him to
his own reflections; but before they rejoined their
party, she spoke again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why did you come to Haifa without making
yourself known to your people, Ferdinand?” she
asked, eager for information.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, dear, not Ferdinand—for the present,” he
corrected, starting slightly at the name. “My coming
to Haifa was a mere chance, and it was not until I
arrived here that I learnt that my brother Lionel was
Governor. I suppose Burstall Abbey has been sold?
Who lives there now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It belongs to Earl Torrens, Lionel’s father-in-law;
but it is standing empty for the present. Do you
remember the nurse—Anne—from Thorpe Burstall?
She came with us to Palestine, and is with us now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anne Whiteside? Yes, I remember her well. I
must be careful, or she will recognise me. She was
always very shrewd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie glanced up at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you would go and see Lady Montella and
Lionel before you go away,” she said, with a touch of
entreaty. “I am sure they would receive you well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I intend to have nothing to do with the Montellas
until my innocence has been proved,” he rejoined
firmly. “I do not desire pity or forgiveness; I want
only justice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will claim your title, surely? Even if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>is not of much value away from England, it is your
right. Some day we may all return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For myself I care nothing; I have roughed it too
long to wish for anything of the sort. If I claim it,
dearest, it will be for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The colour came into her cheeks, and she made no
reply. Of all the strange coincidences she had met
with during her short life, this seemed the strangest.
Her eyes shone with a new light when, a few minutes
later, she rejoined the Princess; and on the homeward
journey she was unusually silent. As they passed
through the outskirts of Haifa, she found herself with
her lover at the head of the little cavalcade a few
paces in advance, and begged him to allow her to
confide in her friend. She was so anxious to tell
someone that she was afraid she would not be able
to refrain from introducing the subject; so Ferdinand,
knowing that the Princess could be trusted, consented.
The occasion was celebrated by a dainty supper in
the hotel, and Raie’s eyes shone as they had never
done before. And even when her lover took his
departure a few days later, the love-light in her eyes
remained, so that the Montellas wondered what had
come to her, and why she was so unusually joyous.
Perhaps the girl wondered at herself, for it seemed
almost incredible that the mere fact of knowing
Ferdinand should make so great a difference. But
the fact remained, and she had no power to prevent
it—indeed, she had no wish that it should be otherwise.
Gazing into her mirror one morning, she was
astonished to find how well she looked—how her eyes
sparkled, and how vivacious was the expression on
her face.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“I shall be quite pretty by the time Ferdie comes
back,” she said softly to herself, exhibiting for the
first time a sense of vanity. “I want to be pretty
for him. For myself, I do not care at all; but for
him—”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she leant her elbows on the dressing-table
and lost herself in a delicious reverie; but
presently a cloud passed over her brow. Supposing
Ferdinand were unable to prove his innocence, what
would she do? Had she the courage to marry him
with a stain upon his name and character; and even
if she had the courage, would it be right for her so to
do? Besides, she could not marry him whilst he
retained his pseudonym, and neither in Palestine nor
England could they be united under the name of
Montella. Looking into the future, she foresaw
difficulties so immense as to be almost insuperable,
but she could not bear the thought of ever having to
give up the man she loved. No sacrifice would be
too great so far as she personally was concerned;
but she hated the thought of grieving the one to
whom she owed more than she could ever repay. It
was not in her nature to act clandestinely or to rebel
against authority, especially when she knew that that
authority was worthy of esteem. So that if it came
to breaking with either Lady Montella or her lover,
the struggle would be keen and bitter; for whichever
way it went she would lose a friend. She could only
hope that what she dreaded might never come to pass,
and that her lover would return with his honour
unimpeached. Once he were able to reclaim his
forfeited rights, all impedimenta to their marriage
would be removed. Her foster-aunt would not
withhold her consent without due cause.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Haifa seems to agree with you better than it
does with us,” her mother remarked, when in the
cool of early morning she betook herself to the little
white bungalow which the Emanuels inhabited.
“You are looking splendid, Raie—different to our
pasty-looking, freckled Harriet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie was sorry for her sister, who, since the
dissolution of her engagement with the young man
who had cruelly jilted her some months before they
left England, had come in for an unpalatable number
of home-truths.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harriet cannot help her freckles, mother,” she
rejoined, taking up the cudgels in her defence. “I
think she finds the climate trying, and I know she
does not like the food.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Emanuel tossed her head in impatience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense!” she exclaimed, with anger. “She
doesn’t give the food a chance; it is all I can do to
get her to eat at all. Ever since her engagement was
broken off, she has done nothing but mope and pine
for Harry Levi. She has lost all her good looks, and
she takes no trouble over her appearance; and I’m
sure the fellow isn’t worth a thought. I’m ashamed
of her, and that’s the truth; I never thought she
would develop into a crotchety old maid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl was silent, scarcely knowing what to say.
Thinking of her own lover, she felt more sympathy
for her unfortunate sister than she dare own. But
when Harriet made her appearance a little while
later, she could not help experiencing a shock. Was
it really love—or the lack of it—that could make such
a change?</p>

<p class='c009'>“She does look ill,” she admitted, when the girl
had left the room, “I wonder if it would do her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>good to stay at Government House for a few days?
I am sure Lady Montella would allow me to invite
her. What has become of Harry Levi, I wonder.
He is not in Palestine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, of course not. He is one of the ‘assimilated’
Jews. I suppose he will marry a <em>shicksa</em>,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and bring
up his children as Christians. He doesn’t deserve to
get on, spoiling a girl’s life as he did. I’d like to
‘assimilate’ him, the scoundrel! There wouldn’t be
much of him left by the time I had finished. I hope
you’ll be more careful when you get a young man,
Raie.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Gentile (fem.).</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Raie blushed to the roots of her hair. “My young
man would not throw me over,” she said playfully,
and quickly changed the subject. With a somewhat
forced carelessness she inquired if her mother were
getting more used to the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Getting used to the place?” repeated Mrs.
Emanuel, in her usual high-pitched voice. “I shall
never get used to Haifa if I live to be a hundred.
When I want to be in bed, I’ve got to get up because
it’s cool, and when I want to be up and about, I’ve
got to go to bed because it’s hot. And as soon as I
move out of doors I’m pestered with a lot of Moslem
beggars, until I come home without a farthing in my
pocket. What with the difference in the food, and
the water that isn’t fit to drink, and the funny people
with their silly jargon, and the stupid currency, which
gives me a headache every time I have to buy anything,
and the peculiar mode of living, it’s enough to
turn one’s hair grey. Besides, the place is overcrowded.
Palestine is too small for all the people who want to
settle down here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie could not resist a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“There is bound to be a little overcrowding until
the people are more dispersed,” she returned convincingly.
“When the other towns are ready to
receive them they will leave the larger cities. There
are building operations going on all over the country,
and in a few years Palestine will be extended to
double its present area. So you see there will be
room for everybody, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me Canonbury,” continued Mrs. Emanuel,
following her own train of thought. “I would rather
live in the Petherton Road than anywhere else in the
world;” and no amount of persuasion or argument
would make her think otherwise. She was too old to
bear transplanting successfully, Raie thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found her foster-aunt and Lionel in the
morning-room when she returned to the Government
House an hour later. They were engaged in a
desultory conversation, for Lady Montella was
writing, but a few words reached her as she passed
down the corridor. Her heart seemed to leap, and
she paused irresolute at the door; for they made
mention of her lover’s name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anne declares she has seen Ferdinand in the
town,” Lionel was saying, as he put down the
newspaper he was reading; “but why should
Ferdinand come to Haifa? And if he did come,
would he not seek us out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then seeing Raie’s figure framed in the doorway,
he spoke of something else, but not before the girl
had had time to hear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdie will have to be careful when he comes
back, or he will be discovered,” she thought, as she
advanced farther into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a very difficult matter to elude the lynx-like
eye of the old nurse, Anne.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> GOVERNOR OF HAIFA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Montella was alone in his study, with books and
papers scattered on the table before him; but
although he was apparently reading, very little of
the printed matter penetrated so far as his brain.
Deep in thought, his brow was furrowed with lines
which should not have appeared on the forehead of
so young a man; indeed, his whole appearance bore
evidence to the fact that he had been severely tried.
It was possible that the responsibility of governing
the English portion of Palestine weighed too heavily
upon his shoulders, or that he took upon himself
more than was absolutely necessary for the welfare
of his people. Certain it was that his energies were
boundless, and that nothing was too great for him to
achieve; but he could not spend himself without
losing some of his inherent vitality, and while he
was indefatigable in his efforts for the public good,
his own health suffered from lack of care.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing which ages a human being so
quickly as worry; and of this Montella had his share.
The race for wealth among the Europeans in Palestine
was keener even than it had been in the West, and
the unscrupulous greed of the people, who, in the
ardour of competition would financially cut each
other’s throats, grieved him more than he cared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>own. Not satisfied with comfort and peace in the
new land, their one desire was to attain to wealth,
the means to which entailed the cost of suffering
to hundreds less fortunate than themselves. To
Montella it was like a disease, sapping the moral
strength of the people at the very root; but neither
he nor his colleagues were able to conquer it; all
they could do was to deprecate the evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now there was a new difficulty with which to
contend. Montella had seen it coming almost from
the first, but he had ever done his best to drive it
back. It arose from the relations twixt civil and
religious Judaism, and threatened to cause a serious
split in the camp. The Chief Rabbi of Palestine,
Ben Yetzel, desired to exercise supreme authority in
imitation of the papal power, whereas Montella and
his party opposed despotism in religious matters, and
favoured freedom of thought. To those who wished
for progress and the civilising influences of the West,
rigid orthodoxy was well-nigh impossible, and they
chafed beneath its yoke; but the sacerdotal dignitaries
declared that the loosening of the ceremonial
ties would eventually mean the downfall of Judaism,
and insisted on the strict enforcement of the letter of
the law. It was the old well-known quarrel between
Church and State, each striving for the mastery, and
neither prepared to grant the concessions which
would make for peace. And the Jews, although
lacking nothing in astuteness, were unable to profit
by the experience of other countries once similarly
placed. They were obliged to learn their hard lesson
alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chief Rabbi’s recent visit to Haifa had been
an inauspicious event. Although famed for his piety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and scholarship, the great man’s views were of
necessity cramped by his narrow surroundings. He
might have been a Hillel or a Gamaliel had he lived
in Hillel’s day; but he could not realise the doctrine
of evolution with regard to the moral nature of man;
and to him the world continued in the same stage of
development as it existed two thousand years ago.
Therefore there were many customs of the English
Jews in Haifa of which he keenly disapproved; and
that the Governor’s wife should be of Gentile birth
but added to his ire. Montella, ardent upholder of
Judaism though he ever remained, was at the same time
clear-headed and rational, and had no patience with
the Talmudic narrowness which converted a thoughtful
man into a mere automaton. His principles of
sincerity and truth abolished all the ceremonial
observances which had degenerated into empty
forms; and he hated anything approaching priest-craft,
even though it were Jewish. His opinions,
happily for himself, were shared by the most
intelligent of his colleagues, who openly showed
their resentment towards the interference of Ben
Yetzel; but the majority agreed that every religious
body should have its head, and respected the Chief
Rabbi’s position too much to presume to criticise
his views.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Hebrew letter from Ben Yetzel lay on the young
man’s desk, and it was this which caused his present
thoughtful mood. Taking up a pen, he began to
translate his reply, but with a sudden gesture of
impatience he tossed it aside. At the same moment
the door opened slowly to admit a small boy in a
white frock, and accepting this as a welcome interruption
to his work, he drew back his chair. The little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>lad ran up to him with a chuckle of delight, and
clambered on to his knee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Daddy, I’se tum!” he exclaimed, giving voice to
an obvious fact. “I’se here, daddy, wif oo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella’s face brightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a naughty little boy to run away,” he
answered lovingly. “What have you done with
nurse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nanna up’tairs in garden wif mammy,” was his
prompt reply. “Me ’tay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he rested his golden head against his father’s
coat, and gave vent to a sigh of satisfaction. A few
minutes later he was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a beautiful boy, and his pink cheeks glowed
with health. In spite of the fairness of his hair and
complexion, his eyes were dark, and fringed with
long lashes of dusky brown. To his parents he was
an endless source of pleasure and amusement, and
nothing delighted them more than to notice his
comical little ways. Montella carried him up to the
roof-garden, and gave him over to the nurse. It was
his usual hour of sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think he has been running about too much,” his
mother said, as the maid bore him away. “It is easy
to get over-tired in this heat. And you, darling, you
look fagged. Can’t you take a little rest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He threw himself down in the deck-chair at her
side, and having asked permission, prepared to smoke.
Patricia applied the match to his cigar, and then
leant back with an expression of content.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is good to have you with me, Lal,” she said
softly. “You have had so little time to spare lately
for baby and me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He glanced into her clear blue eyes with compunction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Never mind, sweet, I will make up for it later on,”
he replied cheerfully. “When I get my full staff of
assistants I shall not have so much to do. What with
Ben Yetzel pulling one way and Engelmacher another,
it takes me all my time to steer clear between the
two. However, I don’t want to worry you with
those affairs; let us throw dull care to the winds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Chief Rabbi does not like me,” Patricia said
thoughtfully. “I felt, all the time he was here, that
he disapproved of everything I did. I wonder why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because he is a confounded idiot,” rejoined her
husband, with heat. “If you had been an old Polish
woman with a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">scheitel</span></i><a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> he would have taken you to
his heart. It’s jealousy, my dearest, nothing else.
He doesn’t like the idea of my having such a sweet
and beautiful woman for a wife. I suppose, too, he
considers you a sort of heathen because you are not
of Jewish birth.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Wig.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I think I am a sort of heathen,” the girl repeated
slowly, with thoughtful eyes. “I am no more a
Jewess at heart than our baby is a Jew. I have tried
to love the Jewish religion for your sake, Lal, but I
can’t succeed. It seems so full of ceremonies which
are beyond my comprehension, and which puzzle me
dreadfully. I am afraid you must be very disappointed
in me, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. I never expected you to follow in my
mother’s steps. <em>She</em> has all the claims of ancestry
and old association to make her love her faith; you
have nothing except your love for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is of our child I am thinking,” she continued
quietly. “How can I teach him his faith as a mother
ought to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Leave it to his grandmother,” Montella advised
carelessly. “It will be a task after her own heart.
There is no need to worry yourself about that, dear;
I assure you little Julian will grow up a strict enough
Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad you are not dissatisfied with me,
Lionel,” she said, placing her hand within his own.
“Sometimes I have thought—and Lady Montella
has hinted—that you would have been happier with
a Jewish wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel sat bolt upright and pressed her hand
to his lips. “Stuff and nonsense,” he returned,
with indignation. “You will make me very angry
if you have such foolish thoughts. I would
not exchange you for all the Jewesses in the
world.” Then he laughed at the idea conjured
up by his last sentence, but added seriously, “Has
my mother said anything to make you unhappy,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, nothing at all. It is not what she
says—” She broke off abruptly, and was silent
for a moment, whilst the colour rushed into her
cheeks. “I love you so passionately, Lionel, that
I cannot bear to think there is any flaw in your
love for me,” she continued hurriedly. “And when
these Jewish ceremonies crop up, they seem like
barriers to drive us away from each other. And
I thought when Ben Yetzel was here that you were
a little bit ashamed of my ignorance of the Jewish
laws. And that is why—because I love you—I
have been so anxious to learn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She nestled her head against his shoulder, and
a tear fell with a splash on to his coat. Montella
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>was startled beyond measure, for she was a woman
who seldom wept. Either she was suffering from
debility, or there must be some serious cause for
her emotion. Hastily he jumped to the former
conclusion—his beloved could not be well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling!” he exclaimed, in dismay, tenderly
stroking her hair. “Whatever has happened to give
you such ideas? I’m afraid I have left you too much
to yourself of late; I am such a selfish creature when
I get wrapped up in my work. Why, Patricia, don’t
you know what people think of you in Haifa? You
are the most admired woman in the town, and the
most respected. And you have endeared yourself to
the heart of everyone by going so much amongst the
poor. Do you want me to tell you that you are my
queen, and that with you at my side, I am the most
fortunate man in the world? Because that is the
truth, and you ought to know it without needing to
be told!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He could not say more; and his words were uttered
with heartfelt sincerity. Patricia, duly comforted,
dried her eyes, and a smile like a burst of sunshine
after rain illumined her face. Feeling that he could
not settle down to work again, her husband fetched
her hat and gloves, and together they sauntered
through the white streets and across the market
square. Their destination, as usual, proved to be
the new house, the inevitable magnet which drew
him towards itself whenever he had a little time to
spare. The builders and decorators were still hard
at work, and the sound of the hammers as they fell
rhythmically upon the stone greeted them as they
approached. A sloping avenue of palm-trees led up
to the principal entrance, and the house, situated on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a slight eminence, commanded a fine view. From
the observatory, which was nearly completed, the
mountain ranges of Galilee and Phœnicia, stretching
away to Lebanon and Hermon in the distance, could
be seen, as well as the Bay of Acre and Mediterranean
Sea. The position was the best that could possibly
have been obtained; for if there were but a breath of
air stirring it would be obliged to find its way here.
Patricia already felt the difference as she seated herself
on the one chair of which the roof boasted, and
drew a deep breath of relief. Montella left her for a
few minutes while he went to give a few directions
in various languages to the cosmopolitan band of
workmen; but in a very few minutes he was back
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your boudoir is nearly finished, dear,” he said,
with jubilance in his tone. “Would you like to come
down and see it? You might make some further
suggestions before it is too late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She rose with alacrity, and they descended the
handsome staircase arm-in-arm. All the rooms were
situated on the ground floor, most of them abutting
on the atrium, in the centre of which was to be
erected a fountain in a colossal marble basin. The
boudoir adjoined the night-nursery, and was octagonal
in shape. It was decorated in white and gold, but
the hangings were of old rose, Patricia’s favourite
hue. The furniture had just arrived, and some of
the pictures already adorned the walls. One, a small
oil-painting of the Thames near Chertsey, had hung
in her old boudoir in Grosvenor Square, and called
up a flood of old and half-forgotten memories. She
sank on to the silken covered settee, whilst her husband
went on a tour of inspection, and gave herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>up to a dreamy recollection of the past. How dull
and prosy it had been in her father’s house, and how
depressing the magnificence of the silent rooms. It
seemed almost impossible to believe that she had
existed for so long with only the companionship of
the phlegmatic Mrs. Lowther, except for the occasional
visits of the Countess of Chesterwood to break the
dreary monotony. What a change the advent of
Lionel had been! He had transformed her life, had
given a zest and interest of which she had never
dreamed, had flooded her heart with the sunshine of
his love. How noble he was, and brave, and good!
She glanced up at his stalwart figure with shining
eyes. She at least had no cause to long for the past.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what do you think of it, Patricia?” he said
playfully, returning to her side. “Does it meet with
your little ladyship’s approval? Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“More than satisfied!” she exclaimed, with ardour.
“The house will be a perfect paradise. But, do you
know, Lal, it all seems unreal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unreal?” he repeated, in perplexity. “How?
It is substantial enough—built of stone throughout.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know. I didn’t mean that. I cannot
realise, somehow, that this is to be our own house.
It is more like a fairy palace than Grosvenor Square.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel laughed, well pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If this is a fairy palace, you are the fairy queen,”
he replied gallantly. “You shall hold your court in
the atrium, and all Haifa will come and do you
homage. Ah, you do not know what pleasant
things are in store for you when we have established
ourselves here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia answered him with a smile, but a sigh soon
took its place. This peculiar air of unreality always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>affected her when she went over this new house.
She could not imagine herself domestically settled
in the place, and although the arrival of the furniture
introduced a more home-like appearance, this feeling
still remained. It was almost like a premonition—a
presentiment that although the house was being built
especially for her, although everything in it had been
chosen in accordance with her own taste, all the care
and thought had been in vain, for the simple reason
that fate ordained that she should never live in it.
It was so unaccountable and inexplicable that she
would not mar her husband’s satisfaction in the place
by worrying him with this foolish fancy. But the
fancy, foolish or not, remained; and the oftener
they visited the house the more certain she became
that the magnificent edifice would never be her
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having completed their inspections, they walked
leisurely back to the Government House, where a
surprise in the shape of Dr. Engelmacher awaited
them. The good doctor was passing through Haifa
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for Beyrout, and intended to stay for two
or three days. Knowing that the two men were
anxious to talk over communal matters, Patricia left
them to themselves. In the library she found Lady
Montella and Raie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her mother-in-law looked up with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to ask you something, Patricia,” she said,
making room for her on the couch. “Do you
remember Miss Lorm?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zillah Lorm,” put in Raie, desiring to be more
explicit. “A dark girl, with nice eyes, splendid figure,
and stand-offish manner. You know her, Patricia;
she sings.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Yes, I know her,” Patricia answered readily. “She
is in England, is she not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella referred to the letter she held in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was; but she will be in Haifa very soon,” was
her reply. “Assimilation does not seem to have
agreed with her very well, and she is evidently
hankering after the Jews in spite of her former desire
to forget her origin. She writes that on account of
a disappointment—of which she gives no particulars—she
is very unhappy, and wishes to join us here for
a time. As I have known her for many years, I should
like to invite her to stay with us for two or three months;
but I would not do so without first consulting you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie made a little grimace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure you do not want her, do you,
Patricia?” she interrupted, with a comically defiant
look at her aunt. “She used to be sweet on Lionel
before he married you, and I know she’s fearfully
jealous of you even now. I don’t like her a bit, and I
don’t know what Aunt Inez can see in her. I am sure
she will come and upset us all if you invite her here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, Raie!” said Lady Montella reprovingly.
“You allow your tongue to run away with you. Miss
Lorm is a very bright and nice woman, in spite of
your opinion. Whether she shall be invited here or
not is for Patricia to decide. What do you say, my
daughter? Shall she come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, if you wish it,” Patricia answered
promptly, but without enthusiasm. She was not
anxious to play hostess to Zillah Lorm, but she was
too certain of her husband’s love to listen to Raie’s
warning. It was not in her nature to entertain that
kind of fear.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> THE COMING OF ZILLAH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So Miss Lorm came, and took up her abode at the
Government House as if it were the most natural
thing in the world, and immediately aroused Raie’s
anger by making great friends with the Princess;
for Raie looked upon the Princess as her own
especial property, and resented the addition of a
third to share their walks and drives. She anticipated
worse to follow, however, for the Princess,
prior to her departure from Palestine, intended to
visit Jerusalem, accompanied by Lionel and Patricia,
so that she would be left to help Lady Montella
entertain the guest. She sincerely hoped that
Ferdinand would not come back until it were a
thing of the past; she did not desire him to meet
Zillah Lorm.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no denying that Zillah possessed an
attractive personality, as well as a magnificent voice.
She seemed to be able to draw people towards her
with an almost magnetic power, and there were few
who refused to be fascinated by her charms. Nevertheless,
she did not improve on acquaintance, for
there was a hardness in her nature which soon made
itself felt. She had no sympathy with the poor and
down-trodden, or with anyone whose sole aim was not
success. Her one desire was to advance in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>world, and her friends were chosen in accordance
with this end. And this ambition sometimes manifested
itself unpleasantly in her words, for she did
not seek to disguise the trait.</p>

<p class='c009'>Strangely enough, Raie was not the only one who
regarded her with dislike. Little Julian manifested
a distinct animosity from the very first day of her
arrival, nor was he to be propitiated by caresses and
presents. He began to cry directly she spoke to
him, and screamed lustily for her to go away. His
parents and nurses tried every means in their power
to win him over, but in vain. He would not kiss
Miss Lorm, neither would he allow her to touch him;
all he could do was to look a picture of misery while
she remained in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was only a baby, and his goodwill of no value
at all; but he was Montella’s child, and Zillah felt
piqued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me sing to him,” she suggested, as the boy
hid his face on his mother’s shoulder. She was certain
of conquering him by the dulcet tones of her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>But even the soothing notes of a lullaby were
powerless to move the stubborn little heart. Julian
fixed his round eyes on the singer for a moment, but
soon looked away. Seeing that he was still obdurate,
Zillah ceased in disgust; after all, it mattered little
whether he condescended to kiss her or not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have never seen baby behave like that before,”
Patricia said, when the others had left the nursery.
“I felt quite ashamed of him before Miss Lorm.
How can you account for it, nurse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The nurse was at a loss for a reply, but Anne
Whiteside came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, there’s no accounting for the likes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>dislikes of children, my lady,” she replied easily. “I
believe they can see further into a person’s character
than we grown-ups can; it’s a sort of second sight, I
think. Now, my Tom, he’s just the same. He took
a dislike to the Arab boy who minds him when I’m
up here, and no amount of coaxing would make him
alter his mind. So all I could do was to send the
boy away and get another; it wasn’t worth while
making the lad ill on that account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not,” was Patricia’s comment. “It is
not the least use to try and force affection. How is
your grandson, by the way? I have scarcely seen
him since we came to Haifa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing delighted Anne more than to discuss her boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s doing fairly well, thank you, my lady,” she
replied, with alacrity. “Of course, he found the heat
trying at first, but he’s getting used to it now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is his brain more active than it was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid not, my lady; he’ll never be no better
than a poor imbecile. Not that I’m complaining,
though; there’s worse things than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to let him sleep in the Cave of Elijah,
Mrs. Whiteside,” advised Raie, suddenly appearing
at the door. “Wouldn’t it make a sensation if he
were to be cured!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, miss!” The poor woman looked bewildered.
“Is it a doctor’s treatment you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; the Cave of Elijah.” She smiled good-humouredly,
not in the least realising the serious
import of her words. “They say that all who are
mentally diseased are cured by sleeping there over
night. I suppose it’s after the style of Lourdes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but it isn’t true, surely, miss?” Her form
trembled like a leaf. “It can’t be true!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“I can’t swear to it, but that is what tradition says.
I think it is supposed to have to do with the influence
of Elijah’s spirit on Mount Carmel. Mustaph, our
guide at the hotel, said he actually knew someone
who was cured.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How came you to hear of it, Raie?” asked
Patricia, with surprise. She was sorry the girl
had mentioned it to Anne, thereby raising false
hopes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard of it when I was staying with the
Princess: the cave is not far from the Mount Carmel
Hotel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And does the Princess believe in it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She neither believes nor disbelieves, because it’s
a sort of faith-cure. When I asked her, she answered
by quoting Shakespeare: ‘<em>There are more things in
heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your
philosophy.</em>’ But the Carmelites evidently accept it
as a fact.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not well to believe too much in such superstitions,”
said Patricia thoughtfully. “I should advise
you not to think about it, Anne.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The nurse looked from the one to the other in a
tremor of excitement. “Oh, but, my lady, if it
should be true! If it should be true!” she cried,
scarcely able to contain herself. “Think what it
would mean to me to see my Tom growing in
mind and body like other boys! Think what a
comfort he would be to me in my old age. Surely
if the cave is so near by it would be sinful not
to try it. Maybe the Lord has brought me out to
the Holy Land for this very purpose, else why
should it happen that I should come to this very
place?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“If faith is wanted, you will not be found lacking,”
her mistress said, with a sigh, as she handed her pet
back to the under-nurse. “But if you are disappointed,
Anne, remember that I warned you. Every countryside
has its legends and superstitions. At Burstall
Abbey we had a magic well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry I have put the poor creature in such
a state of excitement,” Raie said, as they left the
nursery. “Surely, though, she would not be so foolhardy
as to take her little boy to the cave? I would
not spend a night there for all the gold of Ophir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anne will do anything if she thinks it is of God,”
rejoined her friend, as she turned into her own room.
“She seems to see the working of Providence in
every event.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner that evening was considerably enlivened by
the presence of Zillah Lorm, for coming direct from
England, she had much to tell. Owing to her
connection with influential Christian people she had
evaded the Assimilation Act until a few weeks ago;
but her origin having been eventually discovered, she
had been given the option of taking the oath or
leaving the country. Indeed, it was only by the
prompt action on her behalf by a friendly peer that
she had escaped the penalty meted out to such
defaulters. Instead of viewing her position with
anything approaching repentance, however, she
seemed to regard it as a good joke. She was
genuinely elated at having had the cleverness to
defy the authorities for so long a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was Mrs. Athelstan Moore—the Countess of
Chesterwood, I mean—who found me out,” she
informed Lionel cheerfully. “You see, she had met
me at your house and knew something about me;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the others never dreamt that I was a Jewess. Of
course, I took care to avoid all those who already
knew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you had already taken the oath,” said
Lady Montella, from the other side of the table.
“Did you not give me to understand that such was
the case?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I? I have forgotten.” Zillah looked up
with an air of frankness. “To tell you the truth, I
was very near taking it, but when it actually came to
it, I couldn’t find it in my heart to give up all connection
with things Jewish. Not that I care much
for <em>Yiddishkeit</em>—I generally try to avoid it as much
as I can; but as long as I was born a Jewess, I
suppose I’d better die one too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was that your only reason for refusing to
secede?” asked Lionel, with a curious smile. “That
you might die a Jewess? Why not that you might
live a Jewess too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah gave a gesture of insouciance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To live is always more difficult than to die,” she
returned lightly. “Besides, I could not make a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brocha</span></i><a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> over the Sabbath candles to save my life.
It is not in my nature to conform to that sort of
thing.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. Blessing.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“But living in Israel, you will do as the Israelites
do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, as long as no great effort is expected
of me. I should certainly not go out of my way to
offend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your candour is refreshing,” said Lady Montella,
scarcely knowing whether to be shocked or to admire,
“and, unfortunately, your position is a common one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>amongst the Jews of to-day. So long as you do
not actually renounce the faith, you, and those who
adopt your standpoint, think you are fulfilling your
whole duty to it. Why do you cling so ardently to
the thought of dying a Jewess? Is it not because
you cannot bear the thought of being separated from
your own people at the last?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose so,” Miss Lorm admitted. “It is just
a sentiment, or else a prick of conscience. I am not
sure which.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But our religion claims more of you than that,”
the elder lady returned, with a touch of reproach.
“People would not have to talk of the decadence of
Judaism were it not for the neglect and lack of
enthusiasm shown by many Jews. How I long for a
grand revival—a rekindling of Judaism as it was in
the days of old! Surely it ought to take place in
this sacred land of our fathers. And when so
opportune a time as now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes deepened with an intensity of feeling,
and she became lost in thought. Zillah diverted the
conversation into another channel, and began to
speak of English affairs. She wished her ladyship
were not quite so ardent a Jewess; she could not
understand it at all.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> THE CAVE OF ELIJAH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Anne Whiteside was sitting in her own room,
absorbed in thought, whilst near by, in his little white
bed, lay her sleeping boy. Raie’s words had sunk
deep into her mind—so deep that she could think of
nothing else. Had she been told of such a cave in
England she would probably have considered it
unworthy her attention, but here in Palestine the
conditions were entirely of another kind. She
remembered the story of the pool of Bethesda, where
the great multitude of impotent folk waited for the
moving of the water; and to her it seemed quite as
likely for a miracle to happen in a cave as in a pool.
Moreover, the very soil of Palestine was sacred, and
more associated with divine interposition than any
country in the world, so that it seemed to lend itself
to the miraculous as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With God all things are possible,” she said to
herself. “The arm of the Lord is not shortened.”
The physicians were unable to cure the lad, and had
pronounced his case hopeless; but surely no case was
beyond the power of the Great Physician? She was
determined to have faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy awoke, and blinking sleepily at the light,
glanced at his grandmother, but no ray of intelligence
crossed his face. He knew her, of course—he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>take his food at the hands of no one else; but he
showed no sign of recognition, and gazed vacantly
into space. Anne moved the lamp in order to prevent
the glare from hurting his eyes, then fetched
him a glass of fresh cocoanut milk. He drank it
greedily, and asked for more, but the old nurse
thought he had had sufficient, and coaxed him to
try and sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sitting by the bed, she sang a crooning little melody,
such as might be used to lull a baby in a cradle,
whilst her fingers busily plied a pair of woollen socks.
There was no sound to break the stillness but that
of her own voice, yet she was quite oblivious of the
gentle lifting of the latch. A sudden shadow on the
opposite wall, however, caused her to look up
suddenly, and without any sense of surprise she
discovered a swarthy Arab at her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mustaph!” she exclaimed, putting down her
needles in haste. “You have come from the
Princess? What does her Highness say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer he produced a note from the folds of
his inner garment and handed it with a bow. The
nurse took it with trembling fingers and broke the
seal. Then she adjusted her spectacles and turned
towards the light. Mustaph complacently squatted
on the floor.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<em>I think your project considerably fraught with
risk both to the boy and yourself</em>,” it ran; “<em>but if
you are determined to venture, I will not deter you.
To-morrow will be a good opportunity on account
of the full moon, and my carriage will be at your
disposal. Be ready an hour and a half before
sunset, when one of my servants shall call. Please
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>inform Mustaph if this arrangement is satisfactory,
or if you have changed your mind.
Personally, I should advise you to leave well
alone rather than be guided by a Mohammedan
superstition.</em></p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>O. von Felsen-Schvoenig.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To read and digest the note took some little time;
but the Arabs are never in a hurry, and Mustaph
waited with calm patience. Anne sank on to a chair,
with her back to the man and her elbows resting on
the pillows of the bed. ‘To be, or not to be?’ that
was the question which sent a thrill of agitation
through her being. Whether it were better for Tom
to remain as he was—a helpless imbecile—or to
undergo the chance of being cured. Cured! The
very word set all her pulses throbbing, and made the
blood course rapidly through her veins. To have his
intellect restored, to be clothed and in his right mind,
like the demoniac of old, to be a help and a comfort
instead of the burden he ever remained! For she
knew he was a burden, in spite of the assurances she
always gave herself to the contrary. His condition
necessitated more attention than she was ever able
to give him, even though he was watched by some
obliging friend when she was away. Cured! As in
a vision she saw him growing up beside her, his form
no longer delicate and shrunken, but strong and
stalwart with the vigour of youth; his face glowing
with intelligence instead of that vacant expression
which seemed to cleave her heart in twain. If he
were but healthy like other boys, her life would be a
very paradise on earth, for it but needed this to
complete her happiness. A mist rose before her
eyes as she gazed at the poor old-young face, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>large forehead which betokened not intellect but
idiocy, the heavy eyelids closed in sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Christ, dear Lord, help me!” she whispered,
clasping her hands in an agony of indecision. She
knew not what to do for the best.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mustaph, noticing her agitation, rose from the floor
and approached with wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Malaish!</em>” he exclaimed, using the Arab term of
condolence. “What matter? <em>Mafîsh.</em> There is
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cave,” she said, raising her head. “The Cave
of Elijah. You have been there. Is it true that
people are cured?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stared at her interrogatively, scarcely understanding
her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Fen</em>—where? The cave? Boy go? <em>Haiwa.</em>
Yes, varry good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he nodded vigorously, meaning to say that
he knew all about it now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell her Highness I have made up my mind to
try with Tom,” Anne said, deciding suddenly. “I
will be ready at the time she says—before sunset.
But I suppose I had better write it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And finding a pencil, she scribbled the message on
the reverse side of the Princess’s note. She felt as if
she had cast the die.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nodding and smiling, the Arab departed, and she
was left to herself again. The boy was still asleep,
with a look almost of babyhood on his face. If he
suffered in any way by his visit to the cave she was
certain she would never forgive herself; but the
temptation to make the trial was too great to be
passed by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will be cured, Tom!” she exclaimed softly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>as she bent down and kissed him on the forehead.
“I know you will; I can feel it in my heart. No
more weary hours, no more pain, dearest. Oh, to
see you no longer suffering! ’Tis worth the trial of
faith!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She paced the room, scarcely able to contain her
deeply-stirred emotions, and without the least inclination
for rest. And when she did go to bed, sleep
refused to come, so that she tossed the whole night
through, and longed for daylight. But she was up
again at the usual early hour, and fulfilled her duties
with no lack of energy. Fearing to receive discouragement,
she did not inform the Montellas of her
intention to put the matter to the test that night,
and only the Princess, to whom she had rendered
some service in Haifa, was in the secret. Punctual
to the appointed time the car appeared before her
door, with two servants in attendance, and fortunately
there were few people about to wonder at its coming.
Anne’s heart beat fast as she placed the lad in the
most comfortable seat, and took up her position
beside him. The cee-spring and thick rubber tires
on the wheels of the vehicle minimised the jolting,
which would otherwise have rendered the drive more
or less unpleasant, and the white awning served to
protect the occupants from the glare of the sun.
Occasionally a string of soft-treading camels passed
them, their sweetly-sounding bells announcing their
approach; or the peasant-women in their picturesque
blue robes would stand and stare at them, perhaps
in the hope of selling some of the milk which they
carried in pans on their heads. The road on the
mountain side lay between rich and beautiful
vineyards, and as they ascended a glorious view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>expanded before their gaze. Northwards sparkled
the waters of the bay, across which, at a distance of
about twelve miles, lay Akka, once in the coasts of
the Gentiles, but now a Jewish town. Eastwards
rose the hills of Galilee, whose undulating ranges
overlooked Nazareth, Cana, and the Sacred Lake;
and far away in the distance towered the snowy cap
of Hermon, like the only cloud in a clear sky.
Around them was spread the rich flora of the Carmel
ridge, with occasional Druze villages nestling on its
slopes; and close at hand the happy twittering of the
birds fell on the fragrant air. Anne drew a deep
breath of enjoyment, feeling that here—so close to
the scene of Elijah’s victory over the prophets of
Baal—nothing was impossible. The very atmosphere
seemed charged with the miraculous, the Oriental
colouring bridged over the distance from that time of
old. It was the first time she had been any distance
from the town, the first time that she was able to
realise that this was in truth the land of the Bible;
and the fascination of it all crept over her spirit—that
peculiar spell of the Holy Land.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess was waiting for them when they
arrived at the hotel. It was characteristic of her to
treat her inferiors with as much deference as her
equals, and since the nurse had obtained the promise
of this favour, she would not stint the measure of her
goodwill. A substantial repast had been prepared for
them in her private sitting-room; and with her own
hands she ministered to their wants. Yet if at home
in Felsen-Schvoenig her husband had asked for such
an attention, she would have replied that she was
not a serving-maid. She was indeed a mixture of
perversity, but a sweet woman withal.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Tom does not look so well to-day,” she observed,
as she coaxed him to eat. “Do you think the journey
has been too much for him, Anne?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Anne was not sure, but she thought he must have
benefited by the lovely drive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If your Highness will allow me to feed him, I
think he will get on better,” she suggested cheerfully,
and held the spoon to his lips as though he had been
a child.</p>

<p class='c009'>The meal over, they re-entered the little carriage,
and prepared to start for the wonderful cave. Standing
under the stone portico, the Princess wished them
farewell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall think of you to-night,” she said, with a
smile of encouragement. “I hope the cure will
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If God will,” was the nurse’s rejoinder. “I thank
your Highness for the great help you have given me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Princess would not receive her gratitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will send the carriage for you at dawn,” she
called out, as the coachman took up the reins; and
then again wishing luck to the venture, she disappeared
from view.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cave, which was formed out of the limestone
of which the mountain was composed, was reached
shortly after leaving the hotel. A chapel had been
built there to commemorate the place, but it had
been done away with when the Jews came into
possession, and now there existed nothing to distinguish
it from other caves. Coming into it from
the open air, it seemed to exhale an atmosphere of
warm humidity, and the walls, when Anne felt them,
were quite damp. Mustaph had brought with him a
lamp, some warm blankets, and a small folding-chair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>but in spite of these commodities, the place scarcely
promised to be a comfortable one in which to spend
the night. The shadows gathered as they made
their preparations, and the nurse shivered, though
scarcely with cold. Even Tom, who scarcely ever
displayed an emotion of any kind, seemed frightened,
and at first refused to lie down in the strange floor-bed
allotted to him. At sunset Mustaph took off his
shoes, spread his mat, and said his prayers in approved
Mohammedan fashion, after which he took up his
position on guard at the mouth of the cave. The
lighted lamp brought with it a homely ray of comfort,
but it was too small to adequately illumine the
cavern, and the corners were dark and black.
Amidst such eerie surroundings, Anne would not
have been surprised at any apparition or supernatural
manifestation, and as the time wore on, she
worked herself up to an intense pitch of excitement.
Tom lay awake for several hours with wide-open,
frightened eyes, his hands clutching tightly at the
counterpane, whilst in his own way he expressed his
disapproval and fear. At last, however, his hands
unclosed and his features relaxed, and closing his
eyes wearily, he dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Anne heaved a trembling sigh as she sank on to
her knees at his side. Who could tell what would
have happened by the time he awoke again?
Crossing her hands on her breast to still the rapid
beating of her heart, she sent up a passionate entreaty
to Heaven to grant her prayers for the boy. What
would she not do to show her gratitude if only he
were cured of his disease! How devoted her life
would be to the Most High henceforth! She was
not the first soul who has presumed to bribe the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Almighty when in distress: it is a common human
instinct to think that we can gain a divine benefaction
by promising to do something great and magnanimous
in return.</p>

<p class='c009'>The silence was intense, but suddenly it was
broken by a weird and melancholy sound. The
nurse started in affright, wondering from whence it
came, and listened with distended eyes. Moving
towards the entrance, she called to Mustaph, who
was endeavouring to rouse himself from sleep, whilst
the sound continued, just like a cry of woe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A jackal,” the Arab replied imperturbably.
“<em>Malaish</em>—never mind. I tell him <em>imshi</em>—be off!
<em>La!</em> no. He not come here. Ma’am not be afraid.
He only howl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Anne was thankful to hear the sound of a human
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish the night were over,” she said, with a sigh.
“Tom is fast asleep. Are you sure we have done
everything properly? I am so anxious. I cannot
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mustaph suppressed a yawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Allah is good!” he exclaimed wearily. “Ma’am
must sleep, or else Elijah not come. To stay awake
is <em>harâm</em>—forbidden. I tell jackal <em>imshi</em>. Ma’am
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Anne returned to the interior of the cave, and
wrapping herself in a blanket, tried to fulfil the command.
The howling and whimpering of the jackals
continued for some time, but she covered her ears,
and did her best to shut out the sound. She was,
indeed, very tired, and since it was necessary that she
should sleep, she was determined not to keep awake.
Gradually she lost consciousness, until the cheerless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>cave entirely disappeared, to be replaced by a phantomatic
but more happy slumberland. The night
wore on, but nothing happened to disturb her dreams,
and she slept right on until a strip of light in the
east heralded the dawn. Then she awoke with a
start to find her two companions still asleep, the Arab
in his place at the mouth of the cave. Pulling herself
together, she rose and stretched wearily, and then
bent over her beloved grandchild. He was lying in
the same position, but so still that he might have
been a waxen figure instead of a human boy. With
an indefinable sense of alarm she knelt down beside
him, and scarcely knowing what she was doing, felt
his heart and his wrist. Then a low cry of anguish
echoed and re-echoed through the silence of the
cavern—the cry of a broken-hearted woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the light of her life had been extinguished—the
boy was quite dead!</p>

<p class='c009'>She remained in her kneeling position, totally
stunned. It was possible that lying on the floor the
damp vapours had poisoned him, but it did not occur
to her yet to seek the cause; it mattered not how he
died, since there was no hope of his instantaneous
resurrection. But while she knelt, her eyes blinded
with tears, there appeared before her mind’s eye
something which was almost akin to a vision. The
cave in which she had slept for so many hours became
the rock-hewn sepulchre of Mary and Martha’s brother,
and in fancy she heard the sweet but authoritative
Voice: “<em>Lazarus, come forth!</em>” Oh, that that same
Voice might utter the command over the inanimate
figure of her boy! But no, that Voice spake no longer,
save in the souls of men. Of a different nature, though
no less potent, were the miracles of to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“<em>‘He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest it him, even
length of days for ever and ever’!</em>” she quoted, in a
whisper, as her lips touched the ice-cold forehead of
the lad. She had prayed that he might be cured,
that he might spend no more weary hours, and have
no more pain. Ought she not to be happy since God
in His own way had cured the child? Certain it was
that for him there would be no more suffering and
weariness. “<em>‘Even length of days for ever and ever’!</em>”
she repeated, as she went to inform the Arab.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was no longer sorrowful. The boy was cured
at last!</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> EL KÛDS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jerusalem—that much-coveted city of quarrels—was
still under Moslem rule. The Jews—to whom it
was as the golden heart of their country—had done
all in their power to possess it, but the Sultan was
obdurate, and had only bartered Palestine on the
condition that El Kûds—the Holy—should be extra-territorialised.
So the rivalry between the Greeks,
Latins, Protestants, Armenians, Copts and Mohammedans
continued. But the Jews stood on a firmer
footing than heretofore; and if secretly they looked
upon the <em>Harâm</em> with covetous eyes, seeing behind
the Mosque of Omar the dome of their own Temple,
they kept their secret well. The Zionist leaders had
impressed upon their minds the need of maintaining
friendly relations with their rivals; and they were
urged to treat the Christian sacred places with due
respect, in order to show that they were as capable
as the Mohammedans of guarding them intact, if
ever opportunity should occur. That the opportunity
would occur some day, was to them a foregone conclusion;
for however long and weary the waiting,
they were certain that Jerusalem would eventually
be theirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Engelmacher’s house was situated in the south-eastern
suburb of the town, adjoining the Jewish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>quarter. Montella and his wife and child—who were
to be the doctor’s guests—arrived late on a Friday
afternoon, just before the falling of the Sabbath.
They had travelled from Haifa to Jaffa by boat, and
then on to Jerusalem by train, for the new railway
between the two capitals was not yet completed.
Engelmacher received them with a breezy cordiality
which immediately put them at their ease; and his
wife, a typical German frau, busied herself greatly
concerning their comfort. Little Julian, who had
come in the care of the faithful Anne, was installed
in a pretty room transformed into a nursery for the
occasion. Mrs. Engelmacher had no children of her
own, her only little one having died in infancy.
Perhaps that was why she had begged Lady Patricia
to bring hers: she longed for the sound of a childish
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the true Jew there is no happier hour than that
of a calm Sabbath eve. Having rid himself of the
turmoil of his daily labour, he dons his best garb to
meet the Bride of the Sabbath. The Friday night
supper is in itself an institution; and the ceremonial
candles, the sweet wine and cloth-covered bread,
serve as links to unite him to his brethren throughout
the world. So felt Dr. Engelmacher, as with his
velvet cap well set on his head, he intoned the
Hebrew grace. To him the Sabbath had but one
disadvantage: he could not smoke, for as to touch
fire is forbidden, his well-beloved briar had to be
laid aside until on the following evening three stars
appeared in the sky. But he made the sacrifice
cheerfully, even if he sometimes grumbled about it
to his wife. His motto with regard to his religion
was “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse oblige.</span></i>” The more was it to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>appreciated in that it cost something to be a
Jew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your wife is a picture!” he exclaimed to his
guest, when a little while later Patricia, on the plea
of fatigue, excused herself and retired to rest.
“Himmel! what eyes! One can look right through
them to her soul. But she is a thorough Englishwoman.
How likes she the foreign life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I think,” Montella replied, with a
contented smile. “She would make herself happy
anywhere with me; she is only unhappy when she
thinks she disappoints me in not doing the proper
thing in accordance with Jewish law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she is conscientious?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, very; it is her nature. She is the sort of
girl who would be happy in any country and under
any conditions so long as she thought she was doing
the right thing. She is the dearest little woman in
the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little, do you call her?” said Mrs. Engelmacher,
who was short and plump. “<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Um Gotteswillen</span></i>, if she
is little, I must be a pigmy. She is tall and graceful,
such as one reads of. If I were a man I should be
proud of such a wife—eh, Max?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ach well, perhaps.” The good doctor pinched
her cheek affectionately, knowing what she desired.
“For myself I prefer a small wife, because she takes
up less room in a house, and you can put her in your
pocket if there is nowhere else for her to go. Besides,
I like to see a dear Yiddishë <em>ponim</em><a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> at my side. It
would not do for us all to fall in love with fair and
beautiful Christians. Where would Judaism be?”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Countenance.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He laughed heartily, and so did Montella, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>too sensible to take offence. And so the evening
passed, enlivened by anecdotes and jokes, until Mrs.
Engelmacher also said good-night. Left to themselves,
the two men entered upon a more serious
conversation, for in connection with the Rabbinical
faction there was much to be discussed. Ben Yetzel
had openly declared antagonism towards any kind of
reform, and in doing so had practically thrown down
the glove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He came back from Haifa with his hands raised
in holy horror,” Engelmacher said, in his short, dry
accents. “According to him the city is a veritable
hot-bed of heresy. He saw with his very own eyes a
Jewish man carrying a walking-stick on the Sabbath;
and the strange thing about it was that the heavens
did not fall!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ridiculous!” exclaimed the young man, with
contempt. “It is a wonder he will consent to carry
his clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you know he wears his pocket-handkerchief
tied round his knee as a garter because it would be a
sin to carry it in his pocket on the Sabbath. But
there is worse to follow. He went to your house to
dinner in spite of his misgiving as to the orthodoxy
of your menage, and your wife actually offered him
milk in his coffee thirty minutes after he had partaken
of meat! After that he has given you all up
as hopeless; and really, my dear Montella, I think
you might have exercised greater care!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My wife offered him milk in his coffee!” repeated
Lionel incredulously. “I can scarcely believe it.
My mother was in the room, and would surely
have noticed it; she is quite as particular in that
way as Ben Yetzel himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“But how is it there was milk on the tray at all
so soon after dinner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because my wife and Miss Emanuel seldom eat
meat. They find that light food agrees with them
better in this climate. Of course, Patricia, who finds
it difficult to realise the importance of the dietary
laws, <em>might</em> unthinkingly have passed him the milk.
It is a great pity, especially as Ben Yetzel is such a
fanatic. But I dare not say anything to her about it;
she would be very grieved at her mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it isn’t worth while to rake up the matter
now,” said the doctor, relapsing into his native
tongue. “The question is, are we to bow down to
Ben Yetzel or not? Years ago, when I was threshing
out the Zionist question, I thought what a glorious
thing national Judaism would be, but I left the
narrowness of Rabbinical Judaism quite out of
account. In this new State, it seems to me, as to
my contemporaries, that we should let every man
find salvation in his own particular way.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> How
can we, who have suffered so much on account of
religious persecution, afford to deny toleration to our
own brethren? Let every man do that which seems
right according to his own conscience, thereby abolishing
the secret hypocrisy which is so detestable to an
honest soul. To enforce orthodoxy as Ben Yetzel
would do is absolute madness; it will simply mean
the cramping and narrowing down of all the best
that is in us; it will mean the practical ruin of the
State.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Dr. Herzl’s principle.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“And yet you are an orthodox Jew yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am. Use is second nature, you know, and I am
willing to try and set a good example. But I am a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>broad-minded man of the world, and I know that
that world does not end at my own horizon. People
of different temperaments need various forms, even of
the same religion. It is impossible for an Englishman
like yourself, for instance, to beat your breast
like the Polish Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella nodded. “You are a sensible man,
doctor,” he said, with enthusiasm. “But what do
you advise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly know. The bulk of the people in
Palestine are with Ben Yetzel to a man. It is
only the few emancipated, deep-thinking men like
ourselves who have any thought of rebellion. For
the present we must just watch and wait to see how
things go. You will see Ben Yetzel, of course, while
you are here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My people in Haifa expect it of me. I suppose I
must.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then be careful what you say to him. He is an
adept at catching one in one’s words. He loves to
condemn people out of their own mouths; it is a form
of amusement in which he delights.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may rely on me to be discreet,” returned
Montella, with a smile. “I can be as stolid as the
Sphinx when I please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They parted for the night, and the young man went
to his room with a light step. To his surprise he
found Patricia still half dressed, her willowy figure
enveloped in a loose silken wrapper. Sitting with
her elbows resting on the ledge of the open casement,
she looked like some frail sprite in the light of the
moon. Montella went up to her, and tenderly
touched the loosened tendrils of her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you were in bed long ago, sweet,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>She turned towards him with an affectionate
gesture. “I have been talking to Anne,” was her
reply. “It is just a month since her grandchild
died. She seemed very much upset about it, poor
woman, and I think it has done her good to tell me.
I have been trying to console her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the expense of your beauty sleep?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not feel inclined for sleep; I am not so tired
as I was an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must sleep, or you will be fit for nothing
to-morrow,” he urged gently. “What were you
gazing at so intently out of the window?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jerusalem!” she replied, and the words fell almost
musically from her lips. “I look through this casement
window, and I see the city stretched out before
me, with its white domes and flat roofs, and a kind of
spell comes over me as I gaze. See how solitary it
looks, surrounded by those savage hills, and yet it is
the centre of the three great religions of the world, and
the goal of pilgrims from the uttermost ends of the
earth. Even I, who am neither a Jewess by birth nor
scarcely a Christian by faith, cannot help feeling
thrilled. Eight times destroyed, it has come through
fire and blood, and still remains; even Rome cannot
boast of such a record as this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a fascinating goddess Jerusalem is!” he
exclaimed softly. “She intoxicates us all when we
first come within her walls; but you will find that
the charm will wear off when you have been here a
few days. A bird’s-eye view of the city is more
satisfactory, I think, than a closer inspection. She
doesn’t improve on acquaintance, for beneath her
apparently peaceful exterior, there rises the humbug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of her ecclesiastical show-places, the wrangle of
creeds. When you have seen all the sights of the
place, you will find that your pleasing sensations
have gradually evaporated. At least, that was my
experience on my first visit here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are more matter-of-fact than I am,” she
rejoined, almost reproachfully. “I am sure that to
me Jerusalem will always remain the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She closed the casement and turned away, a
thoughtful expression in her eyes. She could not
imagine why the sight of the city should raise such
emotions in her, since she was not bound to it by ties
either of race or faith. She was always moved by
places of historic interest, it was true, and she remembered
how greatly she had been stirred by her first
view of the seven hills of Rome; but Jerusalem impressed
her in an entirely different way, and one which
she could not so easily explain. She had looked
forward with no especial pleasure to her sojourn in
the Holy City, and had come merely because her
husband wished it. Now, however, her feeling was
one of inexplicable delight. She would not have
missed the visit for the world.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> AMID THE SACRED SCENES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Princess Charles von Felsen-Schvoenig was also
in Jerusalem, but she stayed at a hospice in the
Christian quarter, where a friendly bishop and two or
three other English Christians were included among
the guests. In a fortnight’s time she would be <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</span></i> for the Rhenish principality where her husband
was patiently awaiting her return, but at the present
moment her one desire was to “do” Jerusalem
thoroughly, and in this she succeeded fairly well.
Armed with Baedeker’s guide, she called at Dr.
Engelmacher’s house for Lady Patricia, and
chartering a light <em>arabiyeh</em>, drove wherever the
streets would permit. The influence of the British
Consul and Turkish Governor, combined with an
unlimited amount of <em>backsheesh</em>, gained admittance
to the innermost courts of the <em>Harâm</em>, and most
effectually paved the way to the various places of
interest. But the enjoyment of the Princess was
somewhat marred by her inherent scepticism. She
refused to believe in many cases that certain events
happened on the exact spots to which they were
ascribed, and therefore the great fascination of them
was lost. For the city itself she possessed the
deepest reverence; indeed it was this very reverence
which made the morbid hallowing of certain rocks
and stones so repugnant to her mind. Descended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>from a strictly Puritanical race, she found it
impossible to manifest enthusiasm for relics—so
many of them spurious—and the numerous
mementoes sold by avaricious Moslems. The
fanaticism of some of the Latins and Greeks was
to her as incomprehensible as it was revolting.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was obliged to visit the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre by herself; for Patricia, being nominally
a Jewess, was not permitted to enter the sacred
precincts. So she left her friend in the little
<em>arabiyeh</em> to meditate on the ambiguity of her
position, and descended to the paved quadrangle
alone. After what seemed a very long time she
returned, thankful to be out again in the fresh air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” said Patricia, with a smile, as she made
room for her in the carriage. “Did it come up to
your expectations?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—and no,” the Princess replied, sitting down
with relief. “To me the chapels are tawdry in
the extreme, and the building enclosing the Holy
Sepulchre is a miracle of bad taste. But to see the
adoration of the pilgrims is wonderful; what a pity
that the place has been desecrated by so much
bloodshed! I wish you could come with me next
time I go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Impossible,” returned her friend, as the vehicle
pursued its way. “I should be drawn and quartered
by the mob. You forget that I am to all intents and
purposes a Jewess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am,” the girl insisted, as though trying to
convince herself; “otherwise I could not be Lionel’s
wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you are happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“As Lionel’s wife, yes. As a Jewess, no.
Fortunately, my husband’s love is more than compensation
for the difficulty I find in his religion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, by your experience, mixed marriages are a
success?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, where there is such love as ours. Of course I
cannot help wishing sometimes that we were one in
our faith, especially for the sake of the child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you are one in your faith!” exclaimed the
Princess, with surprise. “Have you not become a
Jewess? By your own confession you had no
cherished belief to renounce at the time of your
apostasy—excuse the word.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia sighed, but was silent, scarcely liking to
give voice to her thoughts. They had just passed
through the Jaffa gate on the road to Bethlehem, and
the magnificent view attracted their attention. Wild
mountains stretched above them, varied by occasional
vineyards and olive plantations; and a bend in the
road disclosed that which was said to be Rachel’s tomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stone streets of Bethlehem were so narrow
that the carriage occupied almost all the available
space. Their destination was, of course, the Church
of the Nativity, which stands at the upper end of the
market-place. Passing through the low and narrow
doorway, they descended to the sacred crypt, where
about fifty exquisite lamps hung from the roof. On
the pavement below one of the altars a metal star
had been let into the rock; it indicated the exact
spot where the Holy Babe was born.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This, I believe, is authentic,” said the Princess, as
she bent down to read the Latin inscription on the
star: “‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus Christus natus
est.</span></i>’ Can you realise that this is the very cave—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>outhouse of the khân—in which the greatest event
recorded in history occurred? Is it not wonderful!
The thought almost takes my breath away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had she been a pilgrim and emotional, she would
have knelt and kissed the star. As it was, she stood
by the altar with reverently bent head, her thoughts
concentrated on the stupendous miracle which had
been enacted there. In the adjoining church of the
Latins the choir were singing vespers; and their
voices, subdued by distance, rose and fell in pleasant
rhythm; but within the cave itself there was silence,
and the solemnity of the moment was undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A deep sigh from her friend recalled her to the
present, and with a last look at the star she turned
away. To Patricia the sight of Bethlehem was like a
silent reproach. It recalled with almost vivid clearness
the many Christmas Days of her childhood, and
how thoroughly she had entered into the spirit of the
Festival; for she had been a Christian then. She
was silent as they re-entered their little carriage and
were driven onwards towards the village of Bêt
Sahûr; and the Princess also seemed to have little to
say. Their destination this time was the field “where
shepherds watched their flocks by night, all seated on
the ground”; and arrived there they alighted to stroll
among the olive groves. Near by, the Field of Boaz
brought to their minds the charming idyll of Ruth
the gleaner, and they could almost imagine the sweet
Hebrew maiden gathering the ears of corn. Gazing
down the slopes, they could see far away in the
distance the brilliant waters of the Dead Sea; above
them was the still deeper blue of the Syrian sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is heavenly!” exclaimed the Princess, as she
flung herself down on the dry turf. “It only needs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the music of Handel’s Pastoral Symphony to
complete the scene. The very atmosphere seems to
breathe peace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not think you could be so enthusiastic,” said
Patricia, with a smile. “I thought you were one of
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil admirari</span></i> kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I am—sometimes; it’s just how I feel. Nature
appeals to me much more than the showy buildings
wrought by the hand of man. Do you know, I made
a splendid resolution when we were in the little crypt
of the Nativity. I believe Palestine is making me
good. I suppose you think I can do with it, Pat?”
she added, with a naïve smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia glanced at her curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” she returned honestly. “I believe
your heart is in the right place, and I know you
wouldn’t hurt a fly if you could help it. But you
might be kinder to a certain person, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My husband? Yes. It is concerning him that I
have made the resolution. Of course he is rather
stupid, but I suppose he can’t help it, and I’m afraid
I did treat him rather badly. You see he always let
me squash him; and he is so delicate that it made
me feel mean—as if I had thrown a stone at a child.
If he had placed himself on the defensive, I should
not have minded in the least. But if I smote him on
one cheek, he would turn the other to me also; and
no woman could stand that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why smite him at all?” asked Patricia pertinently.
“Is it not better to live in peace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye—es; but if you were shut up in that grim old
castle at Felsen-Schvoenig with an invalid husband,
I believe even your sweet temper would be tried.
However, I promised God in that little cave of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Nativity that I would go home and try and make
Karl a better wife. I haven’t the least idea what made
me think of Karl just then; his figure seemed to rise
up and reproach me when I was looking at the star.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is an excellent resolution,” said her friend, as
she gazed thoughtfully over the Shepherds’ Field to
the distant hills. “Strange that you should have
to come all the way to Palestine to make it. I
believe there is something in this atmosphere which
stirs us up to spiritual action; I felt it directly we
came to Jerusalem. You would not think it to look
at me, would you?—but I am as worried as I can
possibly be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess looked up sharply, with an expression
of surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Worried?” she repeated. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia pulled up the grass with nervous energy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know if I am wise to talk about it,” she
rejoined slowly; “but I think I can trust you, Olive.
I said a little while ago that I was a Jewess. The
statement was false; I am not a Jewess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No? Well, I never thought you were. What
need is there to worry yourself about that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, you do not understand.” She threw away
the blade of grass, and pressed her hands together.
“I am living, spiritually, a double life, deceiving
others as well as myself. I thought at the time of
my marriage that it was quite easy to renounce
Christianity; and indeed it was then—my soul must
have been in a comatose condition. But since I have
come to Jerusalem, all is changed. These sacred
scenes have revived within me the faith of my childhood;
almost every stone reminds me of the Master
I have denied. It is impossible for one who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>ever been a Christian to gaze on the Holy City
unmoved. Even you have come under the influence
of this wonderful place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that is true. In London and New York
one does not seem to have time or the inclination to
trouble oneself about religion, but here Christianity
is so very real. I understand your frame of mind
exactly. It was absurd to ever expect you to
conform to Jewish law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Montella does expect me to conform to
the Jewish law,” Patricia continued seriously. “She
is always impressing upon me that I have become a
Jewess, and until now I have constantly reminded
myself of the fact. Situated as he is, Lionel <em>must</em>
have a Jewish wife. That is why I am so greatly
troubled. I can no longer pretend to be what I am not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must!” exclaimed the Princess forcibly.
“Since you have married a Jew, you must abide
by the consequence. I believe I know your people
better than you know them yourself. It will never
do for them to find out that you have relapsed—that
there is a heretic within the fold. You must exercise
tact and discretion: learn to be a diplomatist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Learn to be a hypocrite, you mean. It will be a
hard lesson! I am afraid I shall never master it.
After all, what does it matter to the Montellas what
I privately believe so long as I respect their Judaism?
Will it not be better to make a clean breast of it, and
tell them at once?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell them if you like, but do not say that I failed
to warn you. I am older than you, Patricia, and
have seen more of the world. Religion was never
meant to disturb domestic happiness, and break up a
home. Openly declare your faith, and you can no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>longer remain in Palestine. You yourself said that
Lionel must have a Jewish wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The coachman was growing impatient, and seeing
that he wished to return, they bade good-bye to the
Shepherds’ Field. The homeward drive was made
almost in silence, for Patricia was too much disturbed
to speak. She knew that her friend’s view was a
correct one, and that to confess her newly-recovered
faith would cause an open breach. And to leave
Palestine would mean separation from the two dear
ones to whom she was bound by the most sacred ties.
The thought was too terrible to be borne.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must keep silence!” she said to herself. “I
must!” But she knew that at any time her secret
might escape, and she would be lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went back with the Princess to supper, in
accordance with the arrangement they had made
before they started on their expedition; but she was
poor company that night. The conversation of the
guests in the hospice rolled past her like a distant
echo; and even the epigrams of the Bishop (who
was noted for his wit) failed to dispel her troubled
thoughts. She was glad when Lionel came for her
and took her home—although “home” at present was
Dr. Engelmacher’s house. She nestled her head
against his shoulder in the little <em>arabiyeh</em>, and closed
her eyes in dreamy satisfaction. His very presence
imbued her with a sense of protection, and drove
away the worry—at least temporarily—from her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let me be away from you for a whole day
again, darling,” she said, in what he always called the
“baby” voice. “Olive is the dearest woman I know,
but I want you. I seem to have been parted from
you for ages—positively <em>ages</em>!” And then she
laughed in order to drive away a tear.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX<br /> MEMORABLE MOMENTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Montella and the Rabbi Ben Yetzel had quarrelled,
in spite of Dr. Engelmacher’s warning. It was a
great pity, because Ben Yetzel was a dangerous man
to offend; but his decision on certain matters had
been so arbitrary that Montella could not help
protesting, and the discussion had led to hot words
on either side. Engelmacher, knowing that to overthrow
the Rabbinical authority altogether was bad
policy on Lionel’s part, endeavoured to make peace
between them, but in vain. The young Governor of
Haifa declared that he would sell his conscience in
bondage to no man, were he priest or peasant; and
determined to use his own judgment in matters
pertaining to the people. So the incensed Chief
Rabbi literally shook off the dust of Engelmacher’s
courtyard from his feet, and departed in great wrath,
calling down in the choicest Hebrew the vengeance
of Heaven on all concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have done wrong, my boy,” said the doctor
to Lionel in the calm which followed the storm. “It
is never wise to make an enemy, especially such a
man as Ben Yetzel. ‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth’ is his motto. I am afraid he will make you
suffer for what you have said to-day. He holds the
majority of the Palestinian Jews in the hollow of his
hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“Even if it is so, I could not have spoken otherwise,”
rejoined the young man, his eyes still flashing
with the intensity of his outraged feelings. “Ben
Yetzel must do his worst. One generally has to
suffer for right and truth in this world, I find.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“H’m, perhaps so.” The doctor applied a match
to his pipe. “But as ‘this world’—as you so contemptuously
call it—is the only one with which we
have to do, I think we ought to jog along with as
few jars as possible. However, what’s done is done,
and you will have to make the best of it. Be on your
guard against Ben Yetzel—that’s all. He will never
forget that he owes you a grudge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is welcome to pay me back whensoever he
pleases,” Montella said carelessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was too young and too strong to cherish the
smallest fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless he knew that the quarrel was to be
regretted. He had come to Jerusalem, hoping to
improve matters by the aid of diplomacy, and had
failed. It was perhaps that the English method of
handling such affairs did not work in Palestine; but
he could not help that—he was British to the backbone.
What he said he meant with his whole heart,
and the foreign system of prevarication and petty
quibbling was to him as distasteful as it was
unintelligible. Therefore it was impossible for him
to tolerate the slippery dealings of Ben Yetzel and
his clan; a breach had been inevitable from the
first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may as well return to Haifa as soon as the
Princess leaves,” he said to his wife, when he had
given vent to his indignation. “I can do no good
here, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Patricia looked up at him with her blue eyes full
of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor boy!” she exclaimed softly. “You always
seem to be in hot water with these rabbis. They
remind me of the Pharisees of old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are Pharisees—and hypocrites,” he returned,
with a touch of bitterness. “However, I am not
going to trouble about them; they are not worth
it. I shall try to take a leaf out of Engelmacher’s
book: instead of getting angry with them he simply
laughs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is the most sensible way. How many
quarrels would be averted if we could only laugh!”
She sighed, and added regretfully: “I shall be sorry
to leave Jerusalem. It is the most wonderful little
city in the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She would not tell him how much she dreaded
the return to Haifa, but the fact remained. Here, in
Mrs. Engelmacher’s house, she had been comparatively
free from the obligations of the Jewish
ceremonial, but when she took up the domestic
reins once more, the responsibility would again
devolve upon her shoulders. Lady Montella had
been careful to train her in the right way, and
hitherto she had responded with a certain degree of
enthusiasm; indeed, she had been so anxious to do
the correct thing that she had sometimes done more
than was absolutely necessary. Now all was changed.
She felt that she could no longer show spontaneity
in the duties of a Jewish housewife, even though
she meant to perform them conscientiously for her
husband’s sake; and she feared the keenly perceptive
powers of her mother-in-law, who almost
seemed able to read one’s thoughts. The Premier’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>words to her on her wedding-day recurred with new
and added force. She had thought so lightly of her
apostasy at the time; she could see the reprehensibility
and gravity of her action now.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Sunday afternoon—their last Sunday in
Jerusalem—and she had promised to go to the
hospice for tea. The Engelmachers were expecting
friends in the evening, and she was not sorry to
obtain leave of absence; but her husband, on whose
account the company had been invited, was obliged
to remain. She found the Princess in the pretty
hospice drawing-room surrounded by a little group
of admirers, whilst a good-looking curate from
Devonshire obligingly handed round the tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scene was in marked contrast to the glaring
Orientalism without. Patricia felt as if she had been
suddenly transported to a homely English vicarage,
and experienced an indefinable sense of comfort at
the thought. The Bishop was in the midst of one of
his innumerable anecdotes, and was dilating on the
humorous vagaries of a certain Scotch gillie; but he
paused at the most interesting point of the story in
order to fetch the new-comer a chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down here, Lady Patricia,” he said genially.
“You will be able to get a breath of air from the
window.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he resumed his account of the golf-loving
Tammas, to the amusement, if not the edification of
his friendly audience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are all going to St. George’s this evening,”
the Princess informed her, when a momentary lull in
the conversation occurred. “You don’t mind coming,
do you, Pat? The Bishop has been asked to
preach.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“I shall be very glad,” the girl answered promptly.
“It is such a long, long time since I went to church;
I have almost forgotten what the service is like. But
I wonder if Lionel would object? I hardly like to
go without his knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess looked dubious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think he is too broad-minded to object,”
she said thoughtfully. “However, you must do just
as you like; I don’t want Lionel to tell me that I
have led you astray.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he wouldn’t do that,” returned Patricia
quickly, wondering how she should decide. There
was an uneasy sensation at the back of her mind,
that in her present position she ought not to attend
a Christian church; but the desire to form one of
the party conquered. After all, she was acquainted
with so few people in Jerusalem that it was very
improbable that she would meet anyone she knew.
But she made up her mind to tell her husband that
same night; she had no wish to act clandestinely.</p>

<p class='c009'>They set out just as the bells began to ring, the
Devonian curate in attendance. Passing through the
Damascus Gate, they paused at El Hieremîyeh—the
“green hill far away, without a city wall,” which some
believed, with General Gordon, to be the true Calvary,
in preference to the site within the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre. Certain it was that the caves on
the southern side gave it the appearance of “the
place which is called the place of a skull”; and it
was the Jews’ traditional place of execution. Below
was a garden, containing a rock-hewn sepulchre,
which might well have been the “new tomb”
belonging to Joseph of Arimathea; but by some it
was said to be fifth-century work, and its authenticity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>was open to question. To the Princess it seemed
well that the exact locality of the Great Redemption
should never be decided; for the place was surely
too sacred to be desecrated by the wrangling of the
various Christian denominations for its possession,
which had so often led to bloodshed; by gaudy
altars, the bartering of candles, the gross irreverence
of the Mohammedan guardians. Better far that the
exact spot where Divine Love was crucified should
remain unknown, since that knowledge, instead of
making for reverent peace, would only serve to
engender strife.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had just examined the cave called Jeremiah’s
grotto, at the foot of the hill, when Patricia became
conscious of a man in the attire of a Jerusalemite
Christian, who seemed to be watching her with
special intent. Every time she looked in his
direction she encountered the dog-like expression
of his melancholy eyes, and as he did not attempt to
ask for <em>backsheesh</em>, she wondered why he favoured
her with his regard. When they left the grotto, he
walked, or rather glided away in an opposite direction,
but no sooner had they arrived at the Tombs of the
Kings than he suddenly reappeared, although it was
impossible to tell which way he had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia felt vaguely alarmed, but she scarcely
liked to communicate her nervousness to the others.
The last bell of St. George’s opposite had almost
ceased, and there was no time to look at the tombs,
so they crossed over and entered the church without
delay. The man also crossed, peered into the vestibule,
and then withdrew; but, unobserved by Patricia,
re-entered when the service began, and remained
until the beginning of the sermon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>To no one in the sacred building did Evensong
sound more solemn and sweet than to the girl who
for so long had been alienated from her Church.
The General Confession, Psalms, Magnificat, and
Nunc Dimittis brought back a host of recollections
to her mind, even though she had lapsed into indifference
for some time before her marriage. She could
almost imagine herself back in the little parish church
of Newlingham Heath—her father’s village—with her
mother’s memorial tablet and window just above her
head, and the memorial chancel rails a few paces to
the front. Ah, if that mother had lived, what a
different training she would have received! For
the Countess Torrens had been known for her gentle
piety, and it was only since her death that the Earl
had drifted into Agnosticism. Thoroughly repentant
and subdued, she determined to reconsecrate her life
to the Highest, and to do all in her power to atone
for her temporary aberration. The difficulties of the
situation vanished away as she meditated upon the
marvellous compelling power of the Divine. She
was so certain that if she were but true to the highest
instincts of her spiritual nature, all things would work
together for good. The pettiness of the Jewish
ceremonial should trouble her not at all; she would
look through and above it to the Great Majesty
beyond.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a new impress of spirituality upon her
face when, the service over, she left the church. The
Princess guessed the nature of her thoughts, and
instead of criticising—as she usually did—the
sermon, the music, and the congregation, she remained
silent for awhile. The Devonian curate
suggested a walk to the Mount of Olives, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>night was fine, and the moon brilliantly full. So
they betook themselves through the north-eastern
suburb of the city, and past St. Stephen’s Gate, near
where a belated beggar afflicted with the terrible
disease of leprosy called out his melancholy warning
“Lebbra!” and solicited alms. Then down they
went into the Kidron Valley, and past the venerable
olive trees of Gethsemane, where they paused awhile.
Bathed in moonlight, the Sacred Garden seemed
enwrapt by a solemn peace, and as lonely as in the
time of old, save for the little chapel tended by
Franciscan monks. Whether this were the authentic
spot or not, it could not have been far away where
the Agony of the Divine Sufferer had taken place;
for the Mount of Olives was close at hand, and
though all the ecclesiastical localities were spurious,
this sacred mount remained unchanged.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ascent was steep and difficult, but they climbed
high enough to obtain a splendid view. They could
look right down into the Temple area on one side, and
towards Bethany and the Dead Sea on the other.
The air was cool and balmy, and so still that they
scarcely cared to disturb the silence by conversation,
but the Princess could not resist the temptation to
quote some verses of a poem she remembered, which
so beautifully described the scene:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The full moon rose o’er Anathoth,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Against the blue of hill and sky,</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in2'>Till He shall come again and fold</div>

<p class='c009'>“I like that,” said Patricia, with a sigh of enjoyment,
when she had finished. “And oh, how glorious
it is up here! No wonder our Saviour loved to come
here when He wished to be alone. I like this better
than all the other historic places we have seen, because
it is the work of Nature, and there is no chance of
its having been artificially disturbed. The same blue
sky overhead, the same rocks and stones and flowers
as were here over nineteen hundred years ago, when
He walked and taught on these slopes. This is
grander than all the churches which have been
erected in His name; it is an everlasting witness—Heaven’s
own natural church!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Surprised at her own effusiveness, she turned away
and walked a few paces to the rear, alone. It was
something to be remembered, this moonlight night on
the Mount of Olives, with the sleeping city below;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and the emotions of her newly-quickened soul—they
were to be remembered too. How good was God;
how fair was the earth; how sweet was life! Could
she not say with Browning,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>for at this height the troublous details of human
existence sank into insignificance compared with the
grandeur of eternity which knows not time. With a
strange feeling of exaltation she stooped down, and
plucking a tiny flower from the rocky soil, pinned it
gently to her breast. Then with a sigh of perfect
contentment she rejoined her friends. No matter
what sorrow there might be for her in the future, she
was strong—she had braced herself to endure.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER X<br /> THE BLOW FALLS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was quite late (for Jerusalem) when Patricia drove
home in her friend’s little <em>arabiyeh</em>, but the Engelmacher
household was still astir. In the drawing-room
she found her husband playing cards with the
doctor and two other gentlemen, and smoking a
Turkish nargileh. The fumes were not unpleasant,
so she would not allow him to put it away on her
account. Taking the little chair he placed for her,
she sat down at his side. She had no desire to
watch the play—indeed the very sight of cards was
distasteful to her just then; but she liked to be near
her husband, and to talk to him between the deals.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a letter from your father,” he said, when
she had been introduced to Dr. Engelmacher’s friends.
“He has been staying at Burstall Abbey, but thinks
of coming over here on a visit for a change. He has
photographed almost every place of interest in Europe,
and would like to add a few Oriental scenes to his
collection. You would be pleased to see him, would
you not, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She took the letter out of his pocket-book and
read it for herself. Lord Torrens did not write
often, and his epistles were generally brief and to the
point, but this one extended over four pages of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>closely-written notepaper, and had evidently taken
him some time to indite. He said he was longing
for a sight of his daughter’s bonnie face; and as he
usually concealed his feelings by a mask of cold
austerity, Patricia was somewhat surprised. Wrapped
up in his books and hobbies, she had always left him
severely alone unless he particularly asked for her
society. She had never given him credit for the
human sympathy which, in spite of his crusty
exterior, he undoubtedly possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>She put the letter back into the envelope as the
men threw down the cards in order to partake of the
refreshments which Mrs. Engelmacher had thoughtfully
provided; for although they had had supper
scarcely an hour before, they were already thirsty
again. Montella rose and stretched himself with an
air of relief. At the same moment there came a
violent ringing at the courtyard bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Donner und Blitz!</span></i>” exclaimed Dr. Engelmacher,
with resentment. “Is the house on fire? Who has
the impudence to pull the bell so that it can be
heard all over Jerusalem? <em>Dummkopp!</em> Stupidhead!
I will tell him so to his face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He continued to demolish a huge slice of cake,
however, with imperturbability, and carefully filled
his friends’ glasses with wine. A moment later the
door was thrown open with a flourish, and after a
brief altercation without, three men appeared on the
threshold. The foremost was Ben Yetzel, the Chief
Rabbi, in all the glory of his official robes.</p>

<p class='c009'>His visit at that hour, and after his quarrel with
Montella, was so totally unexpected that the occupants
of the room were all taken aback. Dr. Engelmacher
swallowed the remaining portion of his cake in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>mouthful, after which he was obliged to hastily gulp
down a glass of wine to save himself from choking.
His friends stared at the new-comers with curiosity,
and Lionel grasped the back of the chair with an
air of defiance. But the most agitated of all was
Patricia, who had recognised in one of Ben Yetzel’s
companions the man she had met by Jeremiah’s
Grotto, and again at the Tombs of the Kings. No
wonder he had watched her so carefully; he was
evidently in the Chief Rabbi’s service as a spy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judging by the pomposity with which Ben Yetzel
advanced into the room, his errand was aggressive in
intent. Taking not the slightest notice of Montella,
he began to talk to Dr. Engelmacher in Hebrew, his
voice raised in excitement, and his features glowing
with a fanatical light. For a while Lionel took no
part in the colloquy, and listened in silence, with
lowering brow; but at last he could restrain himself
no longer, and spoke in the deep and peculiarly
resonant voice which betrayed his agitation. Then
there ensued a veritable babel of noise and confusion
of tongues; for the simultaneous combination of
Hebrew, German, and English, and all spoken in
anger, did not conduce to the clear understanding of
either side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia had never felt so uncomfortable in her
life. Although she could not understand exactly
what they were saying, she knew that the dissension
was in some way connected with herself. Her one
desire was to escape from the room, but she dare not
attract attention by rising from her seat. So she
remained, until hearing her little boy crying in the
room above, she took courage and moved towards
the door. But the Rabbi’s lynx eyes caught the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>action, and just as she reached the threshold, she was
asked by Dr. Engelmacher to remain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very sorry, Lady Patricia,” he said, in a
more gentle voice than he had used to the men, “but
the Chief Rabbi is labouring under a misapprehension,
and we had better set him right. He
declares, on the authority of his employee here, that
you joined in the service at the Church of St. George
this evening. I have told him that the employee
must have made a mistake, and perhaps confused
you with your friend, the Princess; but he will not
be satisfied until he hears the denial from your own
lips. He wishes you to tell him yourself that you
did not enter the church while service was proceeding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a breathless pause. Patricia remained
standing, her fair face proudly raised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot tell him that,” she said, addressing the
doctor, but looking straight at the Rabbi. “I went
to the church with the Princess—the first time for
many years. I saw no harm in it, or I would not
have gone. I did not think I was being watched.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella beat an impatient tattoo on the table at
his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Absurd!” he exclaimed, with irritation. “Ben
Yetzel has no right to send out spies. Besides, what
harm has my wife done? Surely she can accompany
her friend to church without all this fuss being made?
She went simply on account of the Princess; she
could scarcely have done otherwise, since she was on
a visit to the hospice. Dr. and Mrs. Engelmacher
know that Lady Patricia is a faithful Jewess and
observes the Law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chief Rabbi understood English, although he
seldom cared to speak it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“A faithful Jewess bends not the knee in a
Christian church,” he said. “Yussuf here sat just
opposite her and saw her join in the prayers and
hymns. The lady is not a Jewess, even though she
does profess to keep the Holy Law. She is a
Christian; and for the wife of the Governor of Haifa
to be a Christian is a scandalous thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is not a Christian!” denied Montella, with
heat. “She renounced her Christianity before she
became my wife. Ask her, and she will tell you; she
does not believe in Christ.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the appeal was made to the girl herself.
Patricia felt the eyes of the room upon her, and the
colour rushed to her cheeks. With beating heart she
gazed almost piteously at her inexorable accusers.
Oh, Lionel, most devoted of husbands, most foolish of
men! Why had he put the question direct, with so
much confidence in her unbelief? Neither sophistry
nor prevarication would avail now; she must speak
the truth, even though to utter the words might ruin
her life’s happiness. But then—quick as a lightning
flash the thought came—why give these people the
satisfaction of victory? Why play into their hands,
and witness the chagrin of her husband? Why not
say no in public and yes in private. Ah, but she
could not do that; she dare not again deny her
faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My husband does not know,” she said, in a
stifled voice. “I did renounce Christianity before
my marriage, and I have tried to keep the Jewish
Law until this day, and intend still to do so as long
as it is necessary. But while I have been in
Jerusalem my religious views have undergone a
change. The Chief Rabbi is unnecessarily harsh, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>he is correct in his statement. I do believe in Christ.
I believe in Him with all my heart and soul!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had a thunderbolt fallen, the silence which
succeeded her avowal could not have been more
pregnant with surprise. The Chief Rabbi’s expression
lightened into one of triumph, and his
satellites, taking their cue from him, looked about
them with calm contempt. Dr. Engelmacher spread
his hands deprecatingly, and gave vent to a shrug of
the shoulders which was eloquent with meaning,
whilst Montella—almost stunned by the unexpectedness
of the dénouement—started to his feet in sorrow
and amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Patricia!” he exclaimed, in a voice of poignant
grief. “You don’t mean it—you, who have been so
staunch and true ever since you became a Jewess.
Oh, you don’t realise what you are saying, dearest.
You have been carried away by the emotions called
up by these historic scenes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She shook her head. “I must speak the truth,
dear,” she answered, softly, “or I should despise
myself for a coward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she sank on to a chair, almost overcome with
the heat and the excitement. The blow had fallen;
she dared not think what the consequence would be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the wife of the Governor of Haifa to be a
Christian is a scandalous thing,” repeated Ben Yetzel
quietly, in Hebrew. “Either Mr. Montella must
resign his post, or there must be a divorce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Engelmacher was the only one near enough to
hear his dictum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gently, my dear sir,” he returned, in a tone of
reproof. “If we live, we shall see; there is plenty
of time.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>But he knew that his friend Montella was in a
most difficult predicament, and that it would
need all his astuteness to extract him from the
same.</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose, in order to show that he considered the
interview at an end; and the Chief Rabbi, well
satisfied with the work he had accomplished, took
his departure with due ceremony. There was an
awkward pause when the door had closed behind
him, and Patricia seized the opportunity to escape
from the room. Scarcely knowing whither she went,
she rushed up the shallow staircase to the apartment
which served as her boudoir. Her one desire was to
be alone for a few minutes—anywhere away from the
people she had offended. Opening the door which
led into the night-nursery, she peeped timidly into
the room, and seeing that her baby was alone,
advanced gently towards his little cot. Although
he seemed so still, he was not asleep, but lay
staring up at the pattern on the wall with wide-open
eyes. Hearing the rustle of her dress, however,
he sat up in eager anticipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nanna just gone down’tairs,” he informed her,
even before she asked him. “Baby hot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too hot to sleep?” she asked gently, and lifting
him up into her arms, pushed the curls away from
his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a relief to feel his loving little caress,
to have the golden head nestling against her shoulder,
to hear the piping notes of the baby voice. His
very presence soothed her as no other earthly thing
could have done; he seemed just like a little cherub
of peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mammy not go ’way,” he said contentedly, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>tiny hands grasping her wrist. “Mammy ’tay wiv
baby always?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked up confidingly into her face, but the
expected answer was not forthcoming. A hot tear
splashed on to his hair; and although but a baby,
he knew instinctively that something was wrong.
He did not know that his words had caused a
dread possibility to flash across his mother’s mind—for
the result of that evening’s confession might mean
separation, not only from her husband, but from her
child. Seeing her distress, he began to sob in
sympathy, and clung to her with almost convulsive
force.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mammy not go ’way!” he wailed, over and over
again. “Mammy ’tay with baby!” and he refused
to be consoled, until Patricia declared unceasingly
that she would never forsake him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stayed until he was asleep again, and then,
leaving him in the charge of Anne, returned to her
own room. Too much perturbed to methodically
disrobe, she took her favourite seat by the casement
window, and rested her elbows lightly on the ledge.
The moon still shone with brilliant splendour,
illumining the whole city with its silvery radiance;
and away to the east she could see the Sacred Mount
upon whose slopes she had so recently stood. The
view recalled her lofty aspirations, and endued her
with courage. She was surely not so weak as to
quail at the first attack!</p>

<p class='c009'>But the sound of her husband’s footsteps caused
her heart to beat fast again with apprehension.
What would he say, she wondered, and how display
his anger? She had never seen him angry—at least,
never with her; for in all the four years of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>married life they had not quarrelled once. She
glanced up from beneath her long lashes as he
entered the room, and noticed with a pang of compunction
that he looked haggard and pale. But
although she longed to say something, the words
froze on her lips. Always reserved by nature, she
became suddenly self-conscious, and instead of showing
sympathy, as she longed to do, the result was a
stony silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Montella understood. Locking the door with
his usual care, he advanced towards the dressing-table
and turned up the light. Then taking a little
chair at her side, he grasped both her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Patricia, how could you?” he said, so quietly that
she could scarcely catch his voice. “How could you,
dearest? You do not realise what you have done!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He gazed into the depths of her eyes, as though he
would read her very soul. She looked back, and saw
that there was no anger, but only deep, impenetrable
sorrow reflected there. And then he explained. He
was not so shocked that she had returned to her
former religion—indeed, he had always known that
she had found Judaism difficult; but that she should
have publicly confessed her relapse, and in the very
presence of the Chief Rabbi—that was where she had
done irreparable harm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under those circumstances prevarication was
justifiable,” he said, when she had protested her
inability to answer otherwise. “You could have
said something—anything—only to defy Ben Yetzel
and put him off the track.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I could not tell a deliberate falsehood,” she
answered, in a voice as low as his own. “I am sure
no good ever comes of telling a lie.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“Ah, but you do not understand!” he said, in
agitation. “To Ben Yetzel your admission is the
peg on which to hang his revenge. He has hated
me ever since I opposed his priestly tyranny, and
now he has the power to ruin me. Shall I tell you
the ultimatum he has given to Engelmacher concerning
us? Believe me, dearest, it is as hard for me to
say as it is for you to hear; but it is this: either I
must resign my post—which means leaving Palestine
in disgrace—or—or there must be a—divorce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He brought out the last word as though he could
hardly get it to pass his lips. Patricia pressed her
hands to her face in an agony of feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! no! <em>no!</em>” she cried, in a passionate
voice. “Not divorce! It is too dreadful! Anything
but that! I will go away, to Germany, to England,
anywhere in Europe; but you must remain my
husband, and I your wife. Surely if we are separated
for ever the Rabbi will be satisfied; surely he, a
minister of God, is not so utterly wicked as to wish
to break the most sacred bonds of our marriage.
Let him part us so that we shall never meet again.
In the sight of Heaven I shall always be your
wife!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her self-control collapsed completely, and she
gave vent to such sobs as seemed to come from the
depths of her being. Montella took her in his arms,
and endeavoured to comfort her with the assurance
that the hated contingency should never occur. But
he felt no less miserable in his way than she did in
hers. He knew that their separation was inevitable,
and that it might be indefinitely prolonged. He
knew also that life in Palestine would be almost
unendurable without Patricia at his side.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“Oh, darling, darling, what grief you have brought
down upon us both!” he exclaimed, in anguish.
“Truly did your Christ say, ‘<em>I came not to send
peace, but a sword!</em>’ Is not that sword piercing
your heart and mine? Cursed be all creeds which
bring dissension and sorrow in their wake, which
separate a husband from his wife, a mother from her
child! How can I send you away—you whom I
have sworn to protect and cherish? To know that
you are lonely, and that I cannot comfort you; that
you are ill, and I cannot sit beside you; that you
want me, and I cannot come. Oh, Patricia, they
have laid their finger on the weak spot in my
manhood’s armour! I cannot bear to let you go
away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had never seen him so intensely moved. She
dried her eyes with a feeling almost of awe, and
in her desire to comfort him, recovered her own
self-possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must both be brave, dearest,” she said, in a
broken voice. “If it is necessary for us to part for a
time, it will not last for ever—nothing lasts for ever.
Don’t let us make it harder for each other than we
can help. Let us try to think of the—the—happy
reunion in the future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The future? But when? So far as I know, I
am settled in Haifa for life. If we part, it may be
for years, for we do not know when we shall see
each other again.” He paused, evidently struck by a
new idea, and continued impulsively: “Patricia, why
should we give up our happiness for the sake of
people who do not care two straws whether we live
or die? Why should I slave and toil and worry,
only to be rewarded by base ingratitude? Resign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>my post! Well, why not? What is the governorship
worth in comparison with you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose and paced the room with bent head and
folded arms. It was his moment of weakness, and
the girl knew it; but she could not help considering
the alternative he suggested. If he left Palestine,
they could go and live quietly somewhere on the
Continent; he might even obtain permission to
return to England. At least, it would be better
than an indefinite separation; she did not care
where she lived, so long as she were with him. But
she knew that by so doing he would be guilty of
forsaking his people and losing his honour, and that
she would never forgive herself for having blighted
his career.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dearest; you must not abandon your post
just when you are most needed,” she said, with a
heavy sigh. “An Englishman must do his duty at
the cost of life itself. I know you better than you
think, Lionel. Life would not be worth living to
you without your honour. Besides, it would break
your mother’s heart; in her eyes, you are ever the
dauntless champion of the Jews.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dauntless champion of the Jews!” he
repeated bitterly. “I wonder sometimes if the
Jews are worth championing. Where is the grand
spirit of unity and discipline which held together the
nation of old? Quarrellings, bickerings, murmurings,
grumbling at every semblance of authority, one
striving to out-do the other; that is what one has
to contend with in these days. Oh, how I long to
throw it all up, to let them go their own way, and
end the struggle by the survival of the fittest! How
I long to escape with you to some quiet little spot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>where we might live in peace and quiet happiness
with our child. Since all these people are selfish,
why should not I be selfish too? The temptation
is so great—so great! I have not the power to
withstand it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must!” she cried, in a tense voice.
“Lionel, this is unworthy of you! When the children
of Israel complained and murmured in the wilderness,
did Moses forsake them in disgust? Ah, no; a leader
must expect to suffer by and for his people. Having
put your hand to the plough, you must not look back.
You have been so brave and so noble until this very
day. Do not spoil your record by turning coward
at the last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coward!” The word stung him like a lash.
“Good God, no! But, Patricia—” He turned
towards her with a gesture of appeal. “You love
me? Ah, I know you do! And yet you can urge
me to stick to my guns whilst you go away to live
in loneliness, perhaps for the remainder of your life?
I cannot understand it.... Is this love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of the truest kind,” she answered, her deep
eyes glistening with tears. “‘<em>I could not love thee,
dear, so much, loved I not honour more.</em>’ Do you
think I’m not longing to say, ‘Come with me to the
other end of the world, and leave these people to look
after themselves’? But I must not, I dare not!
Your duty lies in Palestine, and here you must stay.
I know that when you are your old self again, you
will say that I was right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you are right; but I am not of the self-sacrificing
sort. I wouldn’t mind going under fire
and having a bullet put through my head for my
country’s sake—that’s soon over; but I don’t like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>having the agony prolonged.” He flung himself on
to a chair, and added, in a different voice: “What
of the child? My mother will never free you from
your promise to have him brought up as a Jew. She
will do her utmost to retain him in her custody. You
must not let him go back to Haifa if you wish to keep
him with you. Possession is nine points of the law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She shuddered. “It is terrible to have to use
force in the matter. Surely Lady Montella will not
object to my having him with me while he is so
young? I am his mother, and his place is with me.
Afterwards, when he is grown up, it will be a different
matter; but now—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She covered her face with her hands, unable to
finish the sentence. She knew even while she spoke
that she would have to drink her cup of bitterness to
the dregs. To part with her husband was terrible
enough; yet they would both have the consciousness
of having done their duty to sustain them. But in
the case of her child it was different, since there was
no such urgent necessity. She knew that if Lady
Montella succeeded in keeping him from her, her last
ray of comfort would be gone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br /> FAREWELL!</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ben Yetzel was not slow to act on his discovery.
The news of Lady Patricia’s secession spread with
lightning rapidity, and in two days every one in
Palestine who had the slightest connection with
Lionel Montella was aware of it. In these days of
liberty it is difficult to understand the importance of
such an event, but in the eyes of the Palestinian
Jews it was of the greatest consequence. That the
Governor’s wife was not of Jewish birth had always
been a drawback in their eyes, but that she should
openly profess the Christian Faith was unendurable.
Her return to Haifa, therefore, was practically out
of the question, and she decided to leave with the
Princess at the end of the week.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then came the dispute about the child. Lady
Montella was up in arms at the suggestion that he
should accompany his mother to Europe; and arrived
in Jerusalem in hot haste, or at least as soon as the
boat and train would bring her. She said very little
to her daughter-in-law, and maintained a distinctly
cold demeanour; but she spoke her mind freely to
her son, whose filial respect was sadly tried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the happy result of a mixed marriage!”
she exclaimed, with angry sarcasm. “Did I not tell
you that the pride of the Montellas would depart?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Little Julian is practically the last descendant of the
house—for we do not know whether Ferdinand is
alive or dead—and that he should grow up a Christian
would be a disgrace I should never survive. Your
poor father trusted to me to do all in my power to
keep up the honour of the family; to keep it—as it
has ever been till now—purely Jewish. Do you think
that if Patricia takes the boy she will not educate him
in her faith? Of course she will; she cannot do
otherwise, whatever promises she may make.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he is so young,” urged Montella, with reproach.
“You forget that he is only a baby. Why not let
Patricia have the comfort of him until he is old
enough to be taught? It will be several years before
he is able to understand anything of religious matters.
Heaven knows I should miss the little chap if he
left me too, but I think it cruel to part mother and
child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is cruel only to be kind,” she rejoined vigorously.
“Julian must be nurtured in Judaism, must breathe
the atmosphere from babyhood if he is to grow up a
true Jew. The earliest years of a child’s life are the
most important, for it is then he imbibes the ideas
which cling to him till he becomes a man. Soon he
will be old enough to notice the Sabbath candles, and
we shall be able to teach him the beginnings of our
faith. But remove him from all Jewish influence, let
Patricia teach him the Christian Catechism, and
whatever else he may be, he will never grow up a
Jew. No, there is no alternative in the matter; no
compromise is possible. Julian must stay with us to
be properly trained for the responsibilities he will
have to fulfil. Patricia ought never to have married
you if she did not mean to remain a Jewess. If she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>suffers, she has no one to blame but herself. With
us religions are not lightly received to be afterwards
cast away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By which it will be seen that Lady Montella was
obdurate, and did not mean to be gainsayed. If
Patricia intended to take her baby away, it would
have to be by violence, and she was of much too
gentle a nature to think of forcible measures. Moreover,
she knew that Lady Montella was right, and
that if she had the training of the child she could
not help bringing him up as a Christian—thereby
breaking the promise she had made before his birth.
She knew also that, tended by his grandmother and
the faithful Anne, he would be in safe hands; but
this did not compensate her for the grief of the
parting. The wrench was terrible, and on the
morning of her departure she felt that she must set
all at defiance and take him bodily away. The child
seemed to understand what was happening, and
clung to her with the tenacity of fear; and thus,
clasped in each other’s arms, they awaited the dread
signal which should warn them that the hour was come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Montella, away from her religious principles,
was as warm-hearted as it was possible for woman
to be, and could not witness the separation unmoved.
She knew that both husband and wife were suffering
keenly, and that Patricia’s heart was bleeding for her
child. But the sternness of her decision was not
relaxed, and the carriage drove up relentlessly to
take the young mother away. Not caring to see the
final farewell, she joined Mrs. Engelmacher in the
room above; and a few minutes later she knew by
the sound of wheels that all was over, and Patricia
had gone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The Princess was already at the little station when
the unhappy pair arrived. She had never seen either
of them look so ill, but was too wise to express her
concern. Instead, she tried to make light of the
whole matter, and drew their attention to the
peculiar mixture of nationalities and personalities
which composed the motley crowd on the platform.
And there was the luggage to be seen to, and the
red tape of Oriental officialism to be overcome, as
well as the numerous necessities for the journey to
the West. When all was accomplished, however,
there still remained a little time before the train was
due to start; and to the Montellas these few minutes
were the hardest of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel stood with his arm around his wife, and
gazed piteously at the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will take care of my darling, won’t you,
Olive?” he said, with a pathetic air of appeal. “In
letting her go, I am parting with half of my life, and
I know she feels it as much as I do, and perhaps
more, because she is leaving the one little ray of
sunshine she might have retained. But don’t let her
fret, will you? Fretting doesn’t do a bit of good,
and it will make her ill. Perhaps I shall be able to
come over to Felsen-Schvoenig for a holiday next
winter, or—or— Oh, we must look forward to
meeting again soon, however it’s managed or whatever
we do. So you’ll cheer her up, won’t you?
Don’t let her get depressed. And I’ll write every
mail, and—and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>But his flow of language gave way; he could not
bring himself to say another word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’ll cheer her up,” the Princess returned
confidently. “You may rely on me. You both look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>as mournful as if you were parting for ever; but that’s
quite absurd. After I’ve seen my poor old Karl, I
shall go to England and get my sister to work round
that wooden-headed Moore. I fancy from what
Mamie writes that the Expulsion Act is not working
so well as he anticipated. Anyway, coming straight
from the Holy Land, I shall be able to give them
both a piece of my mind. Oh, there’s no knowing
what may happen in another year. You must both
keep up your spirits and hope for the best. It’s a
long lane that has no turning, and I guess yours will
turn pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was so anxious to comfort them that the words
seemed to fall over each other at express speed.
Lionel thanked her from the bottom of his heart, and
did his best to conjure up a wan smile. Then the
signal for starting was given, and the final leavetakings
had to be exchanged. A last fond embrace,
a cordial hand-shake with the Princess, and Montella
assisted the two travellers to mount their somewhat
ungainly carriage. Then a vista of waving handkerchiefs,
of straining eyes, as the train puffed and
snorted on its way; and a few minutes later he was
left standing on the platform surrounded by people—but
alone. Turning resolutely, he made his way
through the crowd and back to Dr. Engelmacher’s
house, his shoulders thrown back, his head bravely
raised. His mother, anxious and suddenly diffident,
awaited him in the drawing-room, and as he
approached the door, gently called his name. But
either he did not hear, or he was not inclined to
respond, for he passed by quickly, and ascended to
the nursery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has gone to his boy for consolation,” said Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Engelmacher, as the baby’s joyful “Daddy!” reached
their ears. “Poor chap! he seems very much—what
do you call it—cut down? No, I meant to say cut
up. Ach, the women! Nine-tenths sorrow to a
man, and one-tenth joy. Poor Montella! I am full
of regrets. He loves his wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but he must love duty more,” Lady Montella
rejoined, feeling a trifle hurt that he had not come
straight back to her. “It will do him no harm to suffer
a little; he is a man, and men are made strong through
suffering. Ah, if I were only a man, what would I
not do for my people, what would I not undergo for
them! Years ago I determined that what I could
not do should be accomplished by my son; and all
my thoughts, my prayers have been centred on him
for that purpose. He must show the world what can
be done by a Jew who has had all the advantages of
Western culture that wealth and influence can procure;
it is his vocation, and he must not shirk it.
That is why I am hard as adamant when any
hindrance occurs. He ought never to have taken a
Christian wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not,” assented the doctor complacently.
“Your sentiments are most admirable, dear lady; but
Montella, though a man, is human, and has a heart.
It is impossible to expect him to be a mere patriotic
machine; and even the greatest patriots in history
have had a feminine angel somewhere in the background.
Ach, the women! But Ben Yetzel was a
beast; it ought never to have been necessary to send
Lady Patricia away. However, whats done is done.
Montella must make the best of a bad business, and
live it down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And upstairs the young Governor was already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>trying to carry out this very injunction. He was
sitting near the open window with the child on his
knee, and battling with the sore and angry feelings
which threatened to rise and overwhelm him. Anne,
busying herself about the room, saw that his face was
white and set, and likened the expression in his eyes
to that of a gazelle who had been cruelly wounded.
But although her kind old heart was overflowing with
sympathy, she had too much tact to speak, and knew
that her respectful silence was perhaps more eloquent
than words. Afterwards he joined the others below,
and entered into their conversation with such zest
that they were almost astonished. Lady Montella
glanced at him with pride, and congratulated herself
upon the fact that he had borne the separation well.</p>

<p class='c009'>But from that day forth he was a changed man.
The iron had entered into his soul.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII<br /> RAIE’S DILEMMA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Zillah Lorm was suffering from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. Haifa,
even with Lady Montella and Lionel close at hand,
was monotonous enough, but Haifa without them
was simply unbearable. She had never liked Raie
Emanuel at the best of times, and to have to be
entertained by her was a hardship to which she
could scarcely submit. But until the Montellas
returned there was no alternative, and she was
obliged to resign herself to the inevitable. She
managed to spend most of her time with some
people whom she had known in England, thus
saving her little deputy-hostess a considerable
amount of trouble. For several days they scarcely
met, except at meals, and even then Zillah did not
always choose to remain at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of Patricia’s departure, however, created
a sensation, which both felt too keenly to ignore.
Raie’s tender little heart was sincerely grieved, for
she possessed a deep affection both for Lionel and
his wife. Miss Lorm, on the other hand, seemed
almost to exult over the affair, and affected an air of
superior wisdom which jarred upon the younger girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a muddle Lionel has made of his life!”
she exclaimed, with unusual complacency. “I
always said the marriage would not turn out well—mixed
marriages seldom do. I believe in her heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of hearts Patricia hates everything Jewish. I suppose
she thought she had had about enough of it here; it
<em>is</em> dull in Palestine for a society girl, I must admit.
Still, she might have managed to make a more
graceful exit; she could have pleaded ill-health as
an excuse for returning to Europe. Anything would
have been better than this: to be publicly expelled
like a naughty schoolgirl!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie gave the cushions on her wicker chair an
unnecessary thump.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand what you mean,” she returned
coldly. “Lady Patricia has been obliged to sacrifice
her home and happiness for the sake of her religion.
It all seems very quixotic, very unnecessary; but—there
it is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fiddlesticks! Who, in these enlightened days,
sacrifices anything for religion? Neither Christians
nor Jews; we are all materialists. What we can see
and understand we believe—for the rest, it is all in
the clouds; let it remain there! No, my dear, you
will never get me to believe that. Patricia has
evidently been sighing for the fleshpots of Egypt,
otherwise the social amenities of English life. She is
well-born, beautiful in her way, and has had the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i> to the most exclusive circles of society. Her
ladyship felt cramped and bored in this insanitary
hole of a place, and surrounded by Jews—always
Jews. She longed to get back to her own sphere, to
entertain in the parental mansion in Grosvenor
Square, to drive in the park, to shop in Regent
Street, to feel civilised once more. The desire was
perfectly natural; I can even sympathise with her.
But religion—no! This is not the age of
martyrdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“All the same, you are wrong—quite wrong,”
returned Raie, with heat. “Patricia was devoted to
her husband and her baby. Do you think she would
have given them up for all the Londons in the
world? You may be a materialist, but she is an
idealist, and with her spiritual things are of vital
importance. You do not understand her, but I do;
and I am certain that away from her husband she
will not go near society or take any part in the
London season. She will probably bury herself in
Thorpe Burstall for the remainder of her life. I am
certain she would never have left Lionel of her own
accord; but she was obliged to speak the truth, and
the Chief Rabbi sent her away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Lorm shrugged her shoulders, still unconvinced,
but did not trouble to argue the matter
further, and at that moment a masculine figure
appeared in the doorway. Possessing fine features,
and presumably English, Zillah wondered where he
could have come from. Raie had walked to the
other end of the garden, and was standing beneath a
shady palm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger advanced with hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon,” he said, doffing his white
cap. “They told me I should find Miss Emanuel
here. I am sorry—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah favoured him with a quick scrutiny, and
decided that he was the handsomest man she had
yet met in Palestine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s all right,” she answered readily. “Miss
Emanuel is here. If you will sit down I will call her.”
And making room for him beside her on the settle, she
let her musical voice enunciate the name—“Raie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie turned quickly and came towards them, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>simple garden-hat pushed carelessly back, and allowing
the dark curls to escape their usual bonds. At
sight of the visitor a warm colour leapt into her
cheeks, and her eyes unconsciously brightened; but
she suppressed the words which rose to her lips, and
formally held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very wrong of him to come in that manner,
even if he did know that the Montellas were away.
She managed to convey this opinion to him, although
she did not put it into actual words. She was
embarrassed and shy, and seemed scarcely to know
what to say; and when she introduced him—as “Mr.
Merryweather”—to Miss Lorm, she did it with a hesitancy
which was distinctly noticeable. She wished
Zillah would leave them to themselves; but Zillah
meant to stop, and to find out as much as ever she
could about the stranger, and to see if she could put
two and two together to make four. So there was a
sense of restraint between them which was uncomfortable
in the extreme, and Raie worked herself up
almost to the verge of tears. But it was worse still
when Zillah, with almost impertinent curiosity, began
to cross-question him with regard to his sojourn in
the Holy Land. She was not satisfied until she had
mentally “placed” him in the order of globe-trotters
to which he belonged; and proceeded with such insistence
that it needed all Mr. Merryweather’s skill to
parry her questions. Raie found herself left out in
the cold, and sat, the personification of silent reproach.
She was almost glad when he rose to take his leave,
and saw him downstairs with an air of dejection.
Away from Miss Lorm, however, her spirits soon
revived; and seeing that the library was unoccupied,
she drew him inside.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>He bent down, and raising her face gently with his
two hands, looked into her eyes with kindly scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” he interrogated, almost quizzingly. “I
have come back. Is not my little Raie pleased?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” she answered, returning his gaze without a
smile; “but—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘But me no buts,’” he rejoined lightly. “I have
displeased you, little girl. Is not that so? What
have I done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should have let me know that you were
coming,” she said, in an aggrieved tone. “You have
put me in a difficult position. Miss Lorm is very
inquisitive; she will want to know all about you—and
our acquaintance—when I go back to her. I
would have had her out of the way if I had known.
I have been in torture during the last half-hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor child!” He bent still further and kissed
her on the forehead. “I ought not to have come at
all; but I was told that the Montellas and Anne were
in Jerusalem, so I thought the coast was clear. I
wanted to give you a pleasant surprise—but there!
I always bungle everything I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!” The grasp on his arm tightened. “It
<em>was</em> a pleasant surprise, and of course you did not
know Miss Lorm was here.” The smile which had
been delayed began to play about her mouth and
eyes. “Tell me what you have been doing,
Ferdinand,” she added eagerly, as he pushed
forward a chair. “I am longing to know. Was
your mission to England successful?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Almost—but not quite. A man I particularly
want to consult—he is a solicitor—is at present in
New York; but he will be back in about six weeks’
time, when I shall have to go to England again.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“In six weeks? Then why did you come all this
way for so short a time? What trouble and expense—just
to see me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He smiled affectionately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are worth any amount of trouble and expense,”
he rejoined gallantly. “But I must be honest. I
have come to Haifa this time for a special purpose;
and I believe you can help me, Raie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?” She became serious. “What is it? Of
course I will help you if I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose from his chair, and closing the door, looked
stealthily round the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are some papers in connection with—the
forgery,” he said, in a low but clear voice. “They
must be in Lionel’s keeping; unless they have been
destroyed, which is unlikely. I want them—I must
have them—in order to verify a certain piece of
evidence in connection with the case. And as I
cannot ask for them without disclosing my identity,
I want you to get them for me, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I? But how can I?” She looked up with a
startled expression on her face. “Lionel keeps most
of his documents at the solicitors’—at least he used to
do in England. I have not the slightest idea where
to look for them. Where do you think they will
be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer, he walked to the iron safe which stood
in the opposite corner, and tapped it with his stick.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is where they will be—docketed all
together with the date 19— and probably labelled
‘Ferdinand.’” He turned towards her with a
gesture of appeal, and held out his hands. “Raie,
you will manage this for me, dear, won’t you? Oh,
you must, you must! It is of such great importance—it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>will finally vindicate my character—it will mean
happiness for us both. Look, this is a patent lock.
I don’t know how it works, but you must seize an
opportunity of watching Lionel open it; and then
by hook or crook you must get hold of the keys.
The papers are of no use to him—he will never miss
them; but they are of the greatest consequence in
the world to me, and it is of no use for me to return
to England without them. Afterwards, when the
whole thing is cleared up, we will tell him all about
it; and I know he will say our action was justified.
Raie—don’t look so strange—it’s nothing; and you
have pluck. Put yourself in my position—an innocent
man falsely accused. Oh, you will do it for me—for
<em>me</em>! I know you will!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stood quite still, and for a moment made no
response. Her face was white, and her brown eyes
looked preternaturally large and troubled. And
when she spoke her voice sounded strangely hoarse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You want me to—steal some papers out of
Lionel’s safe,” she said, with difficulty. “Oh, but,
Ferdinand, I—I can’t; it would not be right. Why
do you not take him into your confidence instead,
and ask him for them yourself? He is such a good
man; he would never betray your trust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not ask you to <em>steal</em>,” he answered, with the
faintest touch of irritation. “I merely ask you to
borrow the documents for me. When I have done
with them—when my counsel have seen them—you
can put them back. My dear child, why will you
not understand? To approach Lionel at this crisis
would be to spoil everything. He may be the best-meaning
fellow in the world, but his course of procedure
would be the very opposite of mine. Oh, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>can’t explain it all; it would take days—weeks!
But surely you can trust me—if you love me,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She took a step forward, and looked at him with
doubt in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do—love you,” she faltered, the colour returning
to her cheeks; “but—but I hate anything that is not
straightforward—that is underhand. Lady Montella
and Lionel have been my best friends ever since I
was a tiny girl; I could not bear to think I was
perhaps acting as a traitor to them in their own
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Loyal little soul! Ferdinand could not help casting
her a glance of admiration, even though he was
vexed by her dalliance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is nothing traitorous about the action; you
exaggerate the importance,” he said; and then
approaching nearer, he made her look straight into
his eyes. “How can I make you believe in me?” he
asked, in a voice which was almost stern, yet sad.
“Raie, I swear to you that I am an honourable man,
that I too would despise this means were the cause
not so vitally urgent. Look!”—he held up the
locket on his watch-chain, and opened it to disclose
a minute but faithful portrait—“here is a picture of
Sir Julian. Remember—I am my father’s son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She glanced down at the well-remembered features
of the late baronet, and up again at the strong face
of the new one, with an indefinable feeling of compunction;
and her will gave way. After all, he was
right; she ought to trust him—she would trust him,
even with her very life. A wave of emotion swept
right through her being, and found expression in the
depths of her brown eyes. He saw it, and knew that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>he had conquered, knew too that the struggle had
been keen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear little girl!” he exclaimed softly. “You
would never forsake a man in distress. Think of
the future; it will mean so much for us both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I will try to do what you want,” she
said, with an effort; “but you must never blame me if
any evil comes of it. I cannot pretend to like the
commission, even though I am doing it for your sake.
But I believe in you—I do believe that you have
been cruelly wronged in the past, although you will
not tell me all. How much time can you give me?
Lionel does not return until next Monday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can have a whole month, dear,” he returned
eagerly, “a few days longer if necessary. I know I
can rely on you to use your discretion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I think I know of a way. Lionel has some
letters of mine locked up in that safe. If I ask him,
he will give me the keys. I shall do it in less than a
month, if I can do it at all. But oh, I wish there
were some other means!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She sighed, and seeing the cloud on her usually
bright face, he did his best to drive it away. Then
promising to meet her at Lionel’s new house the
following day at sunset, he took his departure, and
she was left to meditate on the subject of his request.
After all, it was not so very dreadful: only to take a
few papers out of the safe if she could find them, and
to put them back after they had been read. But it
was the idea of secrecy that she did not like; of
performing an action of which she feared Lionel
Montella would not approve. Since she had
promised, however, there was no retraction possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and she reminded herself of the fact with firmly-set
lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah Lorm could talk of nothing else but “Mr.
Merryweather” that night. She considered him
distinctly handsome, and although his manners were
somewhat colonial, he was evidently cultured and
well-read. Raie listened to her eulogy with a
feeling akin to jealousy, and refused to state how
she had become acquainted with the young man.
Whereupon her interlocutor stormed the citadel
by making certain suppositions, to be contradicted
by Raie if she chose to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A secret love-affair!” she said, when she had
almost exhausted her remarks. “I should not have
thought it of you, Raie. And with a man so much
older than yourself! Do you know anything of his
family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know his people very well,” answered the
girl, almost petulantly; and then she excused herself
and went to bed. She was determined not to discuss
Ferdinand with Zillah Lorm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little chit!” exclaimed Zillah to herself, as she
left the room. “I shall soon stop her game when
Lady Montella comes back. I don’t believe she
knows much more about him than I do. And as if a
man of his calibre could really be in love with a silly
little thing like her! Absurd! He would be much
more likely to fancy a beautiful woman—like myself.
I wonder—”</p>

<p class='c009'>And resting her finely chiselled face on her hand,
she gave herself up to cogitations which were vague,
but pleasant. She was of too unscrupulous a nature
to consider the claims of Raie.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> THE EMPTY HOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Montellas were back in Haifa. They arrived
late in the afternoon, after a stormy passage from
Jaffa, and received a hearty welcome from the two
girls. But of course the absence of Patricia made
itself felt, even though they were careful not to
mention it. It was as if a shadow had fallen on the
house which made them speak softly, as though there
had been a death. Lionel spent the greater part of his
time in his study, and seemed always anxious to get
away from his family. His most constant companion
was his little boy; otherwise he preferred to be alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had dreaded the return to Haifa, and had postponed
it as long as possible, knowing that his worthy
citizens were all agog on the matter of his wife’s
departure. His eyes were open to the mingled glances
of scorn and sympathy which were cast upon him when
he walked through the streets of the town; and he
refused to give the explanation which was expected,
yet could not very well be sought. He took his part
in communal matters with the same energy as of old;
but apart from his official duties he was as immovable
as the Sphinx. Declining all the invitations which
poured in upon him from the wealthier members of
the corporation, he seemed to wish to lead the life of
a recluse. His mother knew not whether to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>displeased or grieved, but remonstrated with him
vigorously on the subject one day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This will never do,” she said, when for the third
time he had absented himself from her weekly
receptions. “You will make yourself unpopular if
you persist in holding yourself aloof socially from
the people. Besides, it isn’t manly, Lionel; you are
wearing your heart on your sleeve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he promised to amend his ways; and the study
saw less of him again; and joining more in the social
life of the town, a little of his old buoyancy returned.
But there always remained a sore place in his heart,
only to be temporarily relieved by the balm of her
precious letters. They arrived with every mail—those
dear messages from his beloved.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been back a full week before he could
bring himself to visit his new house. The operations
of the builders and decorators had been suspended
during his stay in Jerusalem, and he had not yet
given the order for them to resume their work.
Making a sudden decision one morning, however, he
walked quietly up the avenue of palm-trees, and
unlocked the great oaken doors at the entrance to
the hall. The house was, as he had anticipated,
totally deserted, and his steps echoed and re-echoed
drearily on the stone floor. Passing through the
wonderful atrium, whose fame had already reached
from one end of Syria to the other, he entered the
boudoir, and removing the holland covering, sat down
on one of the dainty chairs. What a hideous, ghastly
mockery the whole place appeared! how it seemed
to rise up and taunt him with its emptiness, with its
bright but hollow splendour! He glanced about him
with a shudder, and rested his head wearily on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>hand. The decorations, to which he had given so
much thought—for Patricia; the exquisite frescoes
painted by an eminent Jewish artist—for Patricia;
the beautifully carved bureau with its cunning design—for
Patricia; the hangings of vieux rose—Patricia’s
favourite hue; the little oil-painting of the Thames—Patricia’s
own picture. All for Patricia, the one
woman in the world to whom it was a joy to render
homage; and she had been snatched from him by
the crass stupidity of his people, by the ignorant
prejudice of a stubborn race! Oh, the foolishness of
men, to bow down to the fanatical ceremonialism of
dogma and creed, and turn away from the purest of
all passions—conjugal love! Rising, he threw open
the windows, and with bent head, paced the room;
then espying the flutter of a white gown amid the
myrtle bushes in the avenue, paused in silent wonder.
How came a woman in the grounds—his grounds—not
knowing that he was there?</p>

<p class='c009'>He closed the window, and went forth to investigate,
almost inclined to believe that he was the
victim of an illusion. But no; for as he appeared
beneath the portico, the figure approached and
sauntered leisurely towards him. For one moment
his heart stood still, a wild hypothesis taking possession
of his brain. Patricia in some mysterious way
had come back to him, either in the flesh, or by the
projection of her astral body—he had heard and read
of such things. Thought telepathy, spiritualism—he
had never believed in either, yet he knew by hearsay
that the most wonderful phenomena had actually
occurred; and if to other people, why not to himself?
But the fantastic idea born of his ardent longing was
suddenly doomed to disappointment; the figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>proved to be not Patricia, but merely that of
Zillah Lorm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wondered if you were here,” she said sweetly,
as he advanced to meet her. “Do you know, I come
here every day, just for a walk—the little side gate is
always open. But I have never been inside the house,
although I have heard so much about it. Would you
not like to show it to me? We have a good opportunity
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had never felt more disinclined to play the part
of showman, but knowing that she was really eager
to go over the place, he could not well refuse.
Admitting her by the principal entrance, he allowed
her to wander through the rooms at her own sweet
will, and listened to her enthusiastic observations with
no pleasure, and perhaps a little pain. Yielding to a
feeling he could not describe, he passed over the door
of the boudoir; but Zillah was quick enough to notice
his hesitation, and inexorably demanded a view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Lionel?” she asked playfully.
“Bluebeard’s chamber, or the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></i>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He threw open the door, and stood back for her to
enter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither,” he answered quietly. “It is the room
which was to have been my wife’s boudoir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” She threw him a glance of somewhat steely
commiseration, and proceeded to look about her with
cold criticism. Montella went to the window, his eyes
dreamily scanning the distant mountain ranges of
Galilee. He wanted to be blind and deaf for a few
minutes, until his visitor had concluded her examination
of the room. He did not want to hear her careless
remarks; they affected him like so many knife thrusts.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miss Lorm was not the woman to spare him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>one small thrust. She sat down at the little piano—Patricia’s
own piano—and playing a short prelude,
glided into that song of Goring Thomas’s “A Summer
Night.” Then her rich voice, subdued to a low tone
of sweetness, sent forth its full notes to thrill her
listener and fill the house with music:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<em>Have you forgotten, love, so soon</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>That night, that lovely night in June?</em>’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>She sang without effort, and almost as if her thoughts
were elsewhere, but as the song proceeded, her voice
gained in intensity. Lionel stood immovable, hating
the sound of music in that house and under those
conditions. The empty corridor beyond caught the
echo and threw it back with a hollow and depressing
sound. But she could sing—Heavens, how she could
sing! Whatever soul she possessed seemed to be
concentrated in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not in the humour for music, my friend?”
she said, veering round on the music-stool when she
had finished, to see no gaze of admiration, but only
an unappreciative back. “It does sound strange in
this great unfinished house, I admit. By the way,
when will the workmen have finished? When will
you come into residence here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never.” He turned away from the window and
faced her, with a set look in his eyes, then added, in
explanation: “The house is a wilderness, an empty
barn. It can never be a home—to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No?” She glanced at him questioningly from
under her thick lashes. “But I thought you took
such pride in it. Lady Montella told me long ago
that it was your hobby. And the expense—why, it
must have cost a fortune. What will you do with it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>if you do not intend to live in it? Oh, it seems such
a shame—such a magnificent house—!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall sell it if I can,” he said, meeting the
reproach in her eyes steadily. “I had hoped to
spend many happy years here, but now— It is a
mere white elephant to me. They can call it
‘Montella’s Disappointment’ if they like; I don’t
care. I shall have this furniture removed as soon
as I can; and I shall never come here again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if she should come back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will never come back; it is not possible for
her ever to live in Palestine again. That dream is
over, but of course the awakening is hard: and this”—he
touched the silken hangings behind their cover—“this
all seems part of it. I can’t realise....”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke off suddenly, fearing he said too much.
He had spoken incoherently, and with a sharpness
which betokened deep feeling. Zillah’s features
relaxed into a forced expression of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow!” she exclaimed softly. “You have
suffered, and you are lonely. I can sympathise with
you; for—although you would not think it—I am
lonely too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?” He looked up quickly, to encounter the
radiance of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I left England because I was unhappy,” she went
on, in a confidential tone. “I was engaged to Lord St.
Maur; but he was much younger than myself, and
when his people found out, they persuaded him to
break it off; and he was weak, and consented. Of
course I wasn’t in love with him—he was a mere
boy; but I would have married him if I could, since
the man I did love—once—was beyond my reach.”
She looked at him steadily, and added, in a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>voice: “It is the loneliness I dread, and now I seem
to have no aim in life. What is the use of my voice
in Palestine? The greatest of singers is not wanted
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, perhaps,” he added, in his usual voice,
“but the time will come. At present all our energies
are directed on the things necessary to the welfare of
our citizens, the introduction of hygiene, the prevention
of drought and famine, and so on. Afterwards we
shall be able to turn our thoughts to lighter matters—the
recreation of the people; and then you may be
sure music will not be left out of account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And meanwhile I must wait as patiently as I
can?” She sighed. “Oh, dear, how I hate life—hate
it! The inconsistencies, the mistakes, the waste
of suffering—all one long series of disappointments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet there do occur moments, sometimes,
which make it worth while to have lived!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To you, perhaps, because you have experienced
the joy of requited love, but not to me. Why, even
that shallow-minded little Raie is happier than I am.
She has a lover—she meets him every day, and that
gives her a zest and joy in life which are like the
condiments in food. But I am boring you—” She
paused abruptly, and rose from her chair. “Let us
go, or we shall have the full glare of the sun upon
us. This intolerable heat is another of the evils
which has fallen to our lot to bear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel rose with alacrity, and replacing the
coverings, relocked the door. He could not help
wondering what had made Miss Lorm so unusually
serious, and why she had chosen to favour him with
her confidence. He was silent as they passed through
the atrium, and Zillah, on her part, had little to say.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>She was thinking how much better it would be if
Montella would and could get a divorce, so that he
might be free to marry again. She knew that she
was liked by his mother; and that if it were possible,
she would have a good chance of becoming his
second wife. To be mistress of this mansion! She
caught her breath at the thought, albeit a foolish one.
She knew that Patricia would be his wife as long as
she lived, even though they never saw each other
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you not say Raie had a lover?” asked her
companion, as he closed the great doors. “I did not
know it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah opened her sunshade, and held it daintily at
the back of her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I ought not to have mentioned it,” she
responded carelessly, “but I think you and Lady
Montella ought to know. Raie has not told me much,
but it is evidently a secret love-affair. They meet
clandestinely every day somewhere in this direction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is a Mr. Merryweather, presumably a tourist.
He came to the Government House one evening, and
I was rather favourably impressed. But he is too
old and too worldly-wise for Raie. He must be over
thirty, and has evidently been about a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Merryweather?” repeated Lionel thoughtfully.
“Is he a Jew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; at least Raie says he is, although he has not
the appearance of one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And they made each other’s acquaintance while
we were in Jerusalem, I suppose?” There was a
note of vexation in his voice. “I am surprised at
Raie. My mother will be very displeased. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>perhaps Mrs. Emanuel—Raie’s mother—knows
something about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Lorm gave vent to a little shrug. “Perhaps,”
she replied carelessly. “I do not know. Don’t
say I told you anything about it, will you, Lionel?
Raie would be so cross, and— Good gracious, there
they are!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped suddenly in her walk, and placed
her hand detainingly on his arm. Montella’s eyes
followed the direction of her glance with astonishment,
and he could not resist an exclamation of
surprise. The two delinquents were seated in a
shady arbour, almost concealed by deeply-hanging
evergreens. Their faces were in shadow, but Miss
Lorm recognised the girl’s light hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do?” she asked, with a
touch of excitement. “Catch them red-handed, or
pretend not to see them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know.” Montella paused irresolute. It
was very wrong of Raie to meet a young man in
this unconventional manner, especially as she had
been brought up so strictly; but not being aware
of all the circumstances, he was at a loss to know how
to proceed. He had half a mind to pass by quietly,
and speak to the girl afterwards; but approaching
the arbour he caught the sound of his own name, and
could not help standing still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lionel is wiser than I thought,” the man was
saying, in a tone of dissatisfaction. “So he will not
trust you with the keys? But are you sure you went
the right way to work, Raie, dear? You see if you
looked at all agitated when you asked him, you
probably made him suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His accents were strong and well-bred. Montella
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>started as at a familiar sound, but was almost too
dumfounded to move.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My cheeks did burn,” the girl acknowledged,
almost tearfully. “You see Lionel gave me one of
his straight looks—as if he were reading me through
and through, and I felt so guilty that I dared not say
a word. He gave me my letters out of the safe, and
I just took them and went, thankful to get away. I
did my best really, but it is such a difficult task, dear.
I am sure I shall never be able to succeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, you will,” he returned encouragingly.
“You can ask for the keys to return the letters, and
have another try. Or if it comes to the worst, we
must resort to stratagem; all’s fair in love and war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it?” thought Lionel, who could remain hidden
no longer. Motioning to Miss Lorm to keep in the
background, he suddenly presented himself before
the apparent conspirators. Raie gave a scream, and
turned as pale as her dress; Ferdinand rose to his
feet in an attitude of defence, his large sun-hat well
over his face. For a moment there was a breathless
silence, whilst Zillah looked on with enjoyment.
Then Lionel spoke, although he scarcely knew what
to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the son of Miss Emanuel’s foster-aunt, and
these are my grounds,” he said stiffly. “Hearing my
name mentioned as I passed, I could not help listening
to a scrap of your conversation. I cannot quite
understand what you have to do with this young
lady, who is very young, and has no right to form
any attachment without the consent of her guardians.
From what I can gather from your words, however, I
understand that you pose as her lover merely to
win her as a confederate. I shall be glad of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>explanation, if you please. I can scarcely believe
that Miss Emanuel—of whom I hold a very high
opinion—would deliberately help you to burgle my
safe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He addressed the tourist alone, and vouchsafed not
a glance at Raie. The girl looked appealingly at her
lover, who seemed to be rapidly summing up the
situation. His decision was evidently a desperate
one, for he threw back his shoulders with a gesture
of courage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not a burglar,” he replied, carefully choosing
his words, “and I need not explain unless I choose.
But I know that if I keep silence I shall be putting
Miss Emanuel in a false position, and I would not do
that for the world. It was my intention to keep my
incognito until my innocence was absolutely proved;
but I suppose that is impossible since you have found
me out. Look at me, old fellow. Don’t you know
who I am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pulled off his hat, and stood bare-headed in
the sunlight—a veritable picture of manly strength.
Lionel scanned the rugged face—the deep-set eyes
so like his own—and recognised it even as he had
partially known the voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ferdinand!” he exclaimed in a startled tone.
“What does this mean? How in Heaven’s name
have you come here? Where have you come from?”
and suppressing the hundred and one questions
which rose to his lips, he regarded his step-brother
in bewildered astonishment, whilst Zillah Lorm
advanced, an eager glow in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ferdinand assisted his sweetheart to rise, and
bowed to Miss Lorm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you everything presently, Lionel—when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>we are alone,” he answered complacently. “I
should not like to tire the ladies with an account of
my adventures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah swept past Raie and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I congratulate you on your return, <em>Sir</em>
Ferdinand,” she said, with stress on the title, and
a curious smile on her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Merryweather” had risen considerably in
her estimation during the last ten minutes. No
matter what crime he had committed, he was a
baronet, and evidently not in captivity. She was
determined to enter the lists with Raie.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To Raie the recognition of Ferdinand was the best
thing that could have happened, and a load was
thereby lifted from her mind. The task he had set
her to perform had been most repugnant to her
taste, and she was thankful in the extreme that the
difficulty had been obviated in a more open-handed
way. As it happened, the necessary documents were
not in the safe at all, but in a private bureau in
Montella’s bedroom; so that all her trouble and
heart-burning would have been in vain. Lionel
readily forgave the intended ruse, and produced
the papers without delay. His greatest desire was
to help his step-brother to regain his honour and
good name.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Lady Montella was not so easily won. The
circumstances of the forgery had been very black
against Ferdinand, even if he had been, as was
supposed, the mere tool of another and older man.
She knew that her husband until his dying day had
believed him guilty, had wrested him from his affection,
had deprived him of all his privileges of sonship
to bestow them on her own—the younger—son. If,
therefore, Ferdinand had been wrongfully accused, he
was a much-injured man; but his personality did not
impress her in that way. At least, he bore no malice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>towards any of his accusers, and seemed to desire to
forget the actors in the unpleasant drama of the past.
But, on the other hand, he appeared anxious to claim
his title—valueless though it was in Palestine—to
reinstate himself as a member of his fathers House,
and to win back his reputation as an honourable
man. Until his innocence had been established,
therefore, she preferred to remain on neutral terms.
But she allowed him to come to the Government
House as often as he pleased, even though she would
not yet receive him as a son.</p>

<p class='c009'>He informed her of his desire to marry Raie on
the very first evening of his reconciliation; and
begged that if Mrs. Emanuel gave her consent she
would not withhold hers. Lady Montella knew
not whether to be displeased or glad, and held her
answer in abeyance until Ferdinand should have paid
his intended visit to England; but she sent for Raie’s
mother in order to discuss the affair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raie was not in the room when the consultation
took place, but waited on tenter-hooks in the roof-garden
above. Occasionally sentences in her mother’s
high-pitched voice reached her through the open
window, but she riveted her attention on the book
she was supposed to be reading, and resolutely
determined not to hear. After what seemed an
unconscionable time, she was sent for to express her
views. Lady Montella was, as usual, calm and placid;
Mrs. Emanuel beamed with delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have come to the conclusion that if Sir
Ferdinand is able to establish his innocence in
England, your engagement will receive our consent,”
her foster-aunt said, in answer to her glance of
interrogation; “but are you sure you love him well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>enough to marry him, dear? Remember the
difference in your ages. He is nearly eleven years
older than yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s nothing,” put in Mrs. Emanuel quickly,
before her daughter had time to reply. “It’s much
better than if it were the other way about. Besides,
I should not care for Raie to marry a much younger
man; and if she loves him—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do love him,” said the girl, with fervour. “I
should love him if he were a hundred. If I can’t
marry him, mamma, I shall be an old maid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God forbid!” ejaculated Mrs. Emanuel piously,
under her breath. “Not if I know it.” She had
not yet recovered from the rupture of Harriet’s
betrothal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should advise you not to place too much
confidence in Ferdinand’s success, dear,” advised
Lady Montella thoughtfully. “It is always difficult
to reopen an old case, and two of the witnesses in
connection with it are dead. And you see if he fails
to prove his innocence, the slur on his name remains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but he will succeed, Aunt Inez—he must!”
rejoined Raie, with youthful optimism. She did not
add that she meant to be true to him under any
circumstances, nevertheless such was the case. As
long as she was morally convinced of his innocence,
the opinion of the world mattered little. She
knew, however, that she could not marry him for
some time to come unless the proof were found.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the matter was settled, pending the decision of
the judicial court; and Ferdinand was tacitly acknowledged
as Raie’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</span></i>. There was now no need for
any clandestine trysts, but they still met constantly
in the grounds of the empty house. Zillah often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>passed their arbour in her daily walk, and observing
that they seemed absorbed in mutual admiration,
experienced a pang of envy at her jealous heart.
She had scarcely spoken to Raie since the recognition
of her lover, but she always seemed to have a good
deal to say to Sir Ferdinand whenever she came
across him. Secretly she longed to display her
superior charms; to fascinate him by the power of
her voice and smile. Realising that Lionel was for
ever beyond her reach, she desired to transfer her
attention to his step-brother. That he was already
engaged seemed to trouble her not at all; for until
he were actually married she considered him free.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as the day of his departure approached, and
she had made no progress, she grew desperate; and
on the last evening a crisis came. Raie, as it
happened, was confined to her bed with a cold, and
her lover was obliged to say his farewell by proxy.
Lady Montella conveyed all the tender messages,
after which she drove off to a reception with her son.
Zillah, therefore, was left to entertain Sir Ferdinand
for an hour alone, an opportunity of which she was
determined to make the most.</p>

<p class='c009'>As usual, she tried the effect of music first, and
sang her sweetest songs. She knew, of course, that
he was watching her through a thin haze of smoke;
and felt almost magnetically the power of his eyes
on her face. Then, rising suddenly, she suggested
an adjournment to the roof. She felt, somehow, that
they would both feel less restraint in the open air
and under the light of the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>He helped her to place the filmy lace mantilla,
with its red roses, on her head, and in doing so
his fingers touched hers. She looked up, thrilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>and eager, the colour slowly spreading over her
cheeks; and struck by her expression, he returned
her gaze with surprise. But they exchanged not a
word, and ascended to the garden in silence; and
with scarcely a remark he settled her comfortably in
a deck-chair. Then he lighted a fresh cigar, and
puffed away in contentment, whilst the soft breeze
dispersed the smoke and gently caressed their hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have often wondered what the exact pleasure
is that you men find in the weed,” Zillah observed,
thinking he had gazed long enough at the deep blue
of the sky. “I suppose it soothes you in a way we
women cannot understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really don’t know.” He held the cigar between
his fingers and surveyed it contemplatively. “It’s
all habit, I suppose; but I do think a good cigar aids
one’s mental digestion. And I know that if I am in a
bad temper, a quiet smoke will always pull me round.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Open confession is good for the soul,’” she quoted,
with a smile. “I hope that does not often occur.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What—the bad temper?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but <em>I</em> ought not to say anything.” She
sighed. “People in glass houses should not throw
stones. I am in a bad temper with everybody and
everything, most of all with myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke impulsively, and with such force that
the young man glanced towards her with wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed,” he responded courteously. “That
sounds rather depressing. May I ask for what
reason you have quarrelled with yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah turned her face away, so that the moonlight
caught her classic profile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The reason—oh, simply that I am unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And why?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Because I hate Palestine and everything connected
with it!” she answered, a defiant ring in her
voice. “I came here because I could not help
myself—because—as a Jewess—I could no longer
stay in the old country. I thought from Lady
Montella’s letters that Haifa was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i> of a
place; but she sees everything Jewish from behind
rose-coloured spectacles. To me it is a desert with
scarcely an oasis to break the monotony, with a
climate as sultry as that of the Inferno, and an
atmosphere of brick-dust and tar. Building to right
of us, building to left of us—scaffoldings, ladders, and
paint-pots; what is so depressing as a half-built
town? And as for society—why, there isn’t any
worth speaking of, because the people here will not
recognise distinctions of class. Yesterday a poverty-stricken
woman—an odious, unkempt individual—had
the audacity to approach me in a most familiar
manner, in order to tell me that she lived next door
to my grandfather in Poland, and as my father was
no better than hers, she thought she might claim me
as a friend. That is the result of liberty and equality;
we are all children of Abraham, and education counts
for nothing. Oh, it’s disgusting! I hate it! Until
Palestine gets a king and an aristocracy the country
will not be worth living in to cultured Jews.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She raised herself on her arm, her eyes flaming
with the emotion caused by her outburst. Ferdinand
remarked the passion in her voice, and felt vaguely
stirred. But she did not give him time to speak, and
continued hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to escape—to get away from Palestine,
even at the risk of offending your step-mother. If I
stay here while the country is in its present condition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>I shall only droop and die. Sir Ferdinand, you are
the only man in the world who can help me; but will
you? I have no right—except that of old friendship
with the Montellas—to ask you; and yet—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will help you with pleasure if I can,” he put in,
unable to resist the pathetic look of appeal. “What
is it you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are going to England,” she said abruptly.
“But England does not admit a Jew. Tell me: how
do you intend to evade the authorities?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He flashed her a quick glance. “I have a special
permit from a member of the Cabinet—Mr. Lawson
Holmes,” he replied promptly. “I shall be allowed
to stay until my case is concluded without being
forced to take the Assimilation Oath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you will go as Sir Ferdinand Montella?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I shall retain my old pseudonym <em>pro tem</em>.
We have all come to the conclusion that that will be
best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah drew a deep breath. “Then my scheme is
practicable,” she said, with clasped hands. “I too
cannot enter the country in my own name; but
disguised and under an alias—it is my only chance.
Sir Ferdinand, will you take me with you? It will
only be for the journey; at Charing Cross Station
we can part. Once in England, I have friends to
whom I can go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take you with me?” he repeated, starting with a
feeling of uneasiness. “But, Miss Lorm! I don’t
see how I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? I can go as Miss Merryweather, your
sister—a lady missionary, if you like.” Her eyes
shone naïvely. “Oh, there’s not a shadow of harm
in it. I merely want your protection politically; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>when I arrive there I will write to the Montellas and
explain. I dare not tell them before I go. They
would want to keep me here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And meanwhile?” He flung away his cigar, and
rising, paced the garden in agitation. Then he came
back and stood at her side. “You don’t understand,”
he said, in a voice which sounded almost stern.
“What would my people say; what would Raie’s
feelings be? They might place a wrong construction—might
think.... Oh, no, it wouldn’t do—wouldn’t
do at all. It would place us both in an utterly false
position. You must see that yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah’s mouth grew stubborn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see it at all,” she returned, looking straight
before her. “‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit qui mal y pense.</span></i>’ If Raie
cannot trust you, she is not worthy of your affection.
Besides, it’s so ridiculous. Surely a P. &amp; O.
steamer is large enough to hold us both. In my
part of official sister I need only speak to you at
meals.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ferdinand shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whether you speak to me much or little has
nothing to do with the question,” he said imperturbably.
“Miss Lorm, do be reasonable. If you
were engaged to a man, and that man went on a three
weeks’ journey with another lady—and that lady an
inmate of your house—without telling you, how would
<em>you</em> take it? Excuse my putting it so plainly, but
you give me no alternative. Raie is the most
trusting little soul in the world, but she would not
be human if she did not have her doubts. Were I
to accede to your request, I should be landed in a
most unpleasant situation. Besides, it can’t be done;
my permit is available only for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>His decision was evidently final, and Zillah knew
that it was not to be shaken. Once on a P. &amp; O.
steamer, she had hoped to win him through the
social amenities of life on board ship; and if the
Montellas—as Ferdinand feared—should place a
wrong construction on her departure, so much the
better for the success of her plan. But seeing that
she could not enlist his aid, her dream gradually
and regretfully melted away, until, overcome by disappointment
and mortification, she threw away her
self-control and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not think you would refuse,” she sobbed,
using her handkerchief with great ostentation. “I
had packed my things and made all arrangements;
I could have got off without telling a soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ferdinand hated to see a woman cry, and felt
suddenly mean and despicable. But he could not
bring himself to give way to her desire; something
within him seemed to rise up and say, “<em>Thou shalt
not!</em>” It was his love for Raie, his fear of doing
her a seeming injustice. For himself he cared
not at all—he was too well-seasoned a man of the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Zillah dried her eyes, feeling that she had betrayed
herself for nought, and shivering, asked to return to
the drawing-room. As they entered through the
somewhat narrow doorway, a slender, white-clad
figure rose from the embrasure formed by the
window. Coming from without into the glare of
the artificial light, Ferdinand could scarcely believe
his eyes; but he was not deceived—it was indeed
Raie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was so hot that I could not stay in bed, Ferdie,”
she explained, putting her arm confidingly in his.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Besides, I could not let you go without saying
good-bye properly, dearest, if I had fifty colds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And clinging to him like a child, she drew him into
the library, whilst Zillah was left to nurse her anger
alone. Watching them depart, her heart burned with
impotent rage, as she realised how miserably she had
been defeated. It seemed to her that failure was
written right across her life, that she was pursued by a
hard and inexorable fate. Gifted with a good voice
and personal charms of no mean order, she had been
ambitious—over ambitious to do well. Consequently
she had frequently overreached herself when just at
the point of success. She was at enmity with God,
the world, and herself; and she was obliged to
acknowledge it—she had only herself to blame.
Nevertheless, her courage revived when her first
feelings of depression had dissolved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He goes to England to-morrow without me,” she
said to herself, in a whisper. “Never mind, I shall
soon follow him up. In England I shall at least be
happier than here. Assimilation is the way—I ought
to have done it long ago. Fool that I was to consider
the Montellas! They are intoxicated with their
Judaism—but I—I—am a total abstainer from
Judaism.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she laughed hysterically at her feeble
joke. She was clearly much overwrought.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Patricia left the Princess with her husband at Felsen-Schvoenig,
and journeyed back to London with Lord
Torrens, whom she had met at Port Said. The Earl
was somewhat annoyed at having been baulked of his
Eastern tour; but as he did not care to visit the
Holy Land in his daughter’s absence, his only
alternative was to turn back. Secretly, he considered
Patricia’s action absurdly quixotic, for he could not
in the least understand her point of view. To him
all creeds were but variations of one fundamental
principle, and to quarrel over individual shades of
opinion seemed unnecessary in the extreme. As for
sentiment in religion, he refused to recognise that
at all, since it could be analysed and physically
accounted for by the materialistic exponents of
modern thought. Nevertheless he was considerate
enough not to add to the girl’s suffering by vain
reproaches; he knew that, for the present, it was best
to leave her alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The home-coming seemed so strange that Patricia
felt as if she were in a dream. Coming from the
brilliant sunshine of the East, London looked cold
and grey, and the dresses of the people curiously
prosaic after the gay colours of the Orient. It was
about six o’clock in the evening, and the lamps were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>already lit. Clerks and business people generally
were travelling homewards, newspaper boys were
calling out the special editions of the evening papers,
and the traffic rushed bewilderingly through the
crowded streets. Leaning back in the brougham,
Patricia’s head seemed to swim, for the roads and
shops and people had apparently magnified themselves
tenfold, and loomed large and vast through
the gloom of the evening twilight. She was thankful
when the carriage slackened pace, and pulled up
before the familiar door. But even Grosvenor Square
seemed to have extended in area. She could not
imagine why everything looked so immense.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house was still in a state of metaphorical curl-papers
and overalls, for they intended to stay there
only for one night. By Patricia’s orders, Mrs.
Lowther—her old companion—had taken a small
villa near Richmond, where the girl intended to live
out her days. She established herself there the very
next morning, thankful to have some occupation to
distract her thoughts. The villa, which rejoiced in
the romantic name of “Ivydene,” was light and
pretty, and more attractive in its way than the
solemn magnificence of the parental mansion. Mrs.
Lowther, too, had done all in her power to make it
home-like: there were bright fires in the grates and
flowers in the vases, and the hundred and one little
things which contribute to domestic comfort. The
girl could not help feeling touched by the thoughtfulness
which had evidently been expended on her
account, and as she went over the small but prettily-decorated
rooms, her eyes grew misty with no
far-distant tears. There was one room in particular
which held her spellbound, for the wall-paper depicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>well-known nursery rhymes, such as “Jack and Jill,”
“Little Miss Muffit,” and “Red Ridinghood”; and
in one corner stood a brand-new rocking-horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so sorry,” Mrs. Lowther said, half-apologetically.
“I had thought—had made sure—that
you would bring your little boy.” And she wished
she had had the tact not to allow the young mother
to enter the room just then, for the sight of the
childish appurtenances evidently called up an emotion
of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Patricia begged her not to be concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very kind of you to take so much trouble,”
she said, going to the window and looking at the
tiny lawn without. “Oh, how I wish we could have
Julian here! He is such a lovely boy, Lowthy, and
so wonderfully intelligent. It nearly broke my heart
to have to leave him behind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know how you could,” her companion
returned, almost severely. “It seems unnatural to
part a mother from her child. If I had been
you—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia put up her hands as though to ward off a
blow. “Yes, I know,” she put in hastily. “Don’t
hurt me, dear. If you had been in my place you
would have acted just the same. You don’t understand
what Judaism is—how it used to rise up between
the Montellas and myself like a wall. They would
not let me bring baby away for fear I should make a
Christian of him, which of course I should do; for I
could not help wanting to consecrate his little life to
Christ. Oh, I don’t wish to go over the whole story
again; it is too painful. The Montellas are quite
right from their point of view, and I am quite right
from mine. We must all do what seems to be our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>duty according to our own conscience, even if it
seems hard at the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Lowther regarded her contemplatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How you have changed, Patricia,” she observed,
placing her hand on the rough mane of the horse.
“At the time of your marriage none of these considerations
seemed to trouble you. Did I not warn
you during your engagement that although you
might attempt to enter their Jewish world, you must
for ever remain an outsider? I don’t want to be
cruel, but I can’t help telling you how I regret that
you did not listen to me. For look at your present
position: a wife, and yet practically without a
husband—a mother, and yet without a child. Oh,
you poor dear girl, if you had only taken my advice
you would never have made such a shipwreck of
your life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had she not been sincerely sympathetic, Patricia
would have been irritated by her comments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t regret the past,” she responded
quickly, “not one little bit; and if I had it to live
over again I would marry Lionel just the same. It
is not his fault that things have turned out like this;
it is the fault of a fanatical Chief Rabbi and a narrow
creed. But Lowthy, if you don’t mind, I would
rather not talk about it any more. You see it hurts;
and—and—I shall have to get used to being alone.”
She held up the locket containing the portraits of her
husband and baby, and looking at it thoughtfully,
added sadly: “Not that I want to forget these two
dear ones. The remembrance of them will remain
with me day and night. I can’t yet realise that they
are all those hundreds of miles away; I want to
consult my husband at every turn.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>And then dashing away the tears which in spite of
her will would come, she left the intended nursery,
and descended to the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>It took her some time to settle down to her new
life in Richmond. Lord Torrens, scarcely caring for
the menage of a suburban residence, left after a few
days, but the faithful Mrs. Lowther remained. Of
callers there were none; for Patricia’s object in
coming to live so far out was to avoid those who
would have visited her in Grosvenor Square. She
was in no mood for any kind of social pleasure, nor
for the sympathy of kind but curious friends. So
she kept her arrival a secret from those who would
have been glad to know, and preferred to spend the
greater part of her time in solitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Montella had given her a task to perform.
He wanted to know her version of the condition of
English affairs; and in order to form an opinion, she
was obliged to go out and about. So far as she could
see, the assimilation process seemed, socially, to be
working well enough. The names of Cohen, Jacobs,
and Levy no longer existed; but those of Cowan,
Jackson, and Leigh were on the increase, and
perhaps sounded more euphonious in English ears.
In spite of the exodus of the alien immigrants whose
presence had been so greatly deplored, however,
there were still a great number of the unemployed.
Trade was bad—so bad that the prosperity of many
families of the middle class was seriously threatened,
and complaints were heard on all sides. Several
well-known shops in the West End were shut up,
and the bankruptcy of a celebrated mercantile
house had ruined hundreds. Affairs on the Stock
Exchange were quieter than ever they had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>before, and finance, in the absence of two or three
of the greatest Jewish capitalists, was at a low ebb.
Moreover, people began to attribute the decline in
commerce to the removal of Jewish influence by the
Expulsion. Many said that the Jews who had gone
to Palestine had taken the prosperity of England
with them; many more heartily wished for their return.
Certain it was that a wave of adversity had spread over
the country; the nation seemed to be under a cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not come across many Jews so far,” she
wrote, “although there must still be a great many
here. I went on an exploration expedition to
Canonbury and Highbury last week, and found
most of the houses there to let. The shops there—or,
rather, those that remain—seem to be undergoing
a hard struggle, and I was told on inquiry
that it was because their principal customers in
the past had been those of the Jewish race. The
synagogues have, of course, all been swept away;
but, judging by statistics, there appears to be very
little increase in the attendance at the various
churches. The theatres also are not doing so well
as of old, as a considerable amount of both talent
and patronage has by the Expulsion been sent
away. So the practical side of the Bill does not
answer so well as it did in theory, and by the man
in the street the Government is roundly blamed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She experienced a peculiar sense of gratification in
having to give so unsatisfactory a report. Perhaps
she thought it would comfort her husband to know
that England missed the Jews, and was not flourishing
so well without them; yet she knew that his love for
his native country was such that he could not help
feeling sincerely grieved.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>She had just returned from her peregrination westwards
one day, and was walking through the High
Street on her way home, when she came face to face
with a lady who was preparing to re-enter her carriage.
Patricia, full of her own thoughts, would have passed
on; but the lady, with an exclamation of surprise,
barred the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I have found you at last, you truant!” she
said, in a voice full of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Lady Chesterwood, the wife of Athelstan
Moore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia looked up, half abashed, and held out her
hand, scarcely knowing how to greet her old friend
under the changed circumstances. But Mamie had
heard the whole story of the Montellas’ separation
from the Princess, and had the good grace not to refer
to the affair. She insisted on taking the girl into a
neighbouring tea-shop in order to have a chat, and
gossiped away to her heart’s content. Then she
suddenly remembered the purpose for which she
had come out, and broke off in the middle of her
conversation to ask Patricia’s advice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I meant to call and ask the doctor to come and
look at Phyllis—Athelstan’s child, you know; but I
have not made up my mind whether to do so or not,”
she said, with an expression of doubt. “Athelstan
slept in town last night, but I expect him home to
dinner; and if he hears that the doctor has been, he
will be so frightfully alarmed. He absolutely worships
that girl; and if her little finger aches, he immediately
makes up his mind that she is going to die. So I
never send for the doctor unless it is really necessary;
it doesn’t seem worth while to have a fuss for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“What is the matter with her?” asked Patricia
equably. “Nothing serious, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, only a sore throat; a cold probably. I dare
say she will be better to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A sore throat,” repeated Patricia meditatively.
“I don’t like anything the matter with the throat. I
should send for the doctor if I were you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would? Well then, I think you ought to
help me to bear the brunt of Athelstan’s alarm.
Come to dinner, and bring your she-dragon with you
if you like. You know where we live: the other
side of Richmond Park—Ravenscroft Hall. We
dine at seven o’clock, but I shall expect you at
half-past six. Now”—as Patricia prepared to remonstrate—“I
know you are going to put all sorts of
objections in the way, but I shall not accept one of
them. I will take absolutely no refusal; you <em>must</em>
come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear Mamie, how can I?” The girl
looked almost bewildered. “To meet the Premier in
his own house at dinner, after he has been the means
of sending my husband to the Antipodes! Oh, it’s
impossible! Can’t you see the irony of it? There
can be no friendship between a Montella and
Athelstan Moore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the Countess, unconvinced.
“Richmond is not Downing Street. In our
own house we have nothing to do with politics;
besides, Athelstan may not put in an appearance
after all. Don’t be so absurdly sensitive, Pat; I want
you to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Patricia still hesitated. The thought of being
a guest at Mr. Moore’s table was so repugnant that it
could scarcely be tolerated; yet she felt a secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>curiosity to meet the great anti-Semite again. She
would, at least, have something of interest to report
to Lionel; and although she could not introduce the
subject of the Expulsion, she might indirectly glean
an inkling of the Premier’s views. So—not without
misgivings—she yielded, and promised to be there
by the appointed time. Whether good or evil would
come of the visit, however, remained to be seen; and
as she left her friend, she felt as if she were about to
trifle with edged tools.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> AN ANTI-SEMITE STILL</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The “she-dragon,” as Mamie unkindly dubbed Mrs.
Lowther, did not care to accept the invitation to
Ravenscroft Hall, and asked to be excused; so
Patricia dressed herself in a simple evening-gown
and drove off alone. Excitement had lent a touch of
colour to her cheeks, and as the carriage swept up
the avenue she trifled nervously with her long neck-chain
of pearls. Arrived at the house, however, she
soon regained her self-possession, and followed the
footman up the stone staircase with her usual
equanimity. The Countess received her with
cordiality; but seemed curiously diffident. She
glanced at the door every now and then with
marked uneasiness; her mind was evidently—on
some account—disturbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The doctor has not been yet,” she said, in answer
to Patricia’s enquiry. “I am expecting him every
minute. I don’t quite like the look of Phyllis; she
has been shivering so terribly. I do hope she isn’t
going to be ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has Mr. Moore seen her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, he has not arrived yet, but he will be here
soon. He wired that he is bringing Mr. Lawson
Holmes back with him.” Her brow grew troubled.
“I want to keep him away from Phyllis until after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>dinner, when I hope the doctor will have been. The
children always come in to dessert, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The words had scarcely passed her lips when the
scrunch of carriage wheels on the gravel approached
them, and the hall door closed with a heavy sound.
A moment later the men’s voices were heard on the
stairs, as they parted to go to their respective rooms.
The Countess, excusing herself to her guest, went
dutifully to greet her husband; but she returned
before Patricia had time to notice her absence, and
together they descended to the rooms below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you will find a great change in Athelstan,”
she said, as Patricia glanced at the large portrait of
the Premier which adorned the wall. “He has aged
terribly during the last three years, and suffers
from periodical fits of depression which seem to take
all the life out of him. The doctors cannot account
for it, and put it down to overwork. But I believe I
know what it is: there is something preying on his
mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?” Patricia looked up half wonderingly. “I
suppose he is troubled about State affairs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Countess waxed confidential.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the Jews,” she said impressively, forgetting,
perhaps, the political position of her friend. “I
believe they’ve affected his brain. He thinks about
them all day, dreams about them at night, and talks
about them in his sleep. It’s Jews, Jews, Jews—always
Jews! The fact of the matter is, that in
pushing the Expulsion Bill he made a tremendous
mistake; and he knows it, and is suffering from
remorse. But in spite of this he maintains his ground,
and won’t budge an inch from his original standpoint.
He is as hard and as obstinate as a piece of flint.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Patricia turned over the leaves of a magazine with
agitation. “Mamie, ought you to tell me this?”
she asked, feeling that she had received a confidence
which should have been withheld. “Do you think
your husband would care for me to know that he is
attacked by remorse? Remember, I am the wife of
an exiled Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care anyway,” the little woman returned
recklessly. “If you can act on that knowledge, so
much the better. Oh, Patricia! you do not know
what I have suffered during the past two years.
You do not know what it is to have a husband so
morose that he will scarcely speak, except to say
something unkind. For the first few months of our
married life, Athelstan was as genial and happy as a
boy; but now—now—his only smile is for Phyllis—never
for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She sank on to a chair, a look of wounded pride
in her eyes. Patricia was genuinely sorry, but she
scarcely knew what to say. She remembered the
boasted power, the desire to rule which had animated
the Countess at the time of Moore’s proposal.
Where was that conquering influence of her feminine
personality which was to have decided not only the
affairs of her husband, but also of the State? Gone—all
gone; nay, it had never been there. For Mamie’s
will was far too frail to have ever run counter to that
of the Premier; and now, after repeated storms, only
a crushed and broken spirit remained.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl sympathised as best she could, and skilfully
drew the conversation to matters of lighter
trend. She did not want to hear such secrets, and
shrank from prying into the private life of her
husband’s enemy. But Mamie was naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>loquacious, and her thoughts expressed themselves
in words almost as soon as they entered her mind.
It was probably this very garrulity which had sent
Moore back into his shell; for knowing that his wife
could not be trusted with a secret, he naturally
became more reserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were both glad of the presence of Mr. Lawson
Holmes at the dinner-table that night. He was a
man who could converse well on almost any subject,
and possessed a good many interests besides that of
politics. Moore was, as usual, preoccupied and
gloomy, and had shaken hands with Patricia as
though she had been a complete stranger. The
Countess, who had quietly been called away to see
the doctor before the commencement of the meal,
was pale and silent, so the two guests had the
conversation principally to themselves. When the
dessert was reached, however, the Premier suddenly
awoke as from a sleep, and fixing his steely eyes on
his wife’s face, inquired solemnly for the children.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Chesterwood’s eyes fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leslie was a naughty boy this afternoon, and I
was obliged to punish him,” she returned quietly.
“And Phyllis—Phyllis is not well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not well?” Moore became visibly alarmed.
“What is the matter with her? Has the doctor
been?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; he says she has a bad sore throat, and
must stay in bed. He suggested moving her to the
south wing of the house, because it is warmer there
and the aspect sunnier, so we have done so. And he
doesn’t think much of Leslie’s old nurse, so he is
going to send a trained nurse from the hospital, and
perhaps an assistant as well.” She paused, out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>breath. “He is coming again to-morrow morning,”
she added rapidly, “so you can see him then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Moore tossed off a glass of wine, and excusing
himself, rose from the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not wait until to-morrow morning,” he
said, in a rough voice. “I shall see him to-night.
But I must have a look at the child first. Poor little
girl! A sore throat—” and without finishing the
sentence he left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment’s silence, and then the
Countess also rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose I shall have to tell him,” she said, with
an interrogative look at her two guests. “The child
has a touch of diphtheria; that is why we have
thought it best to isolate her at once. It is not
serious at present, but of course there is no knowing
how it may turn out. I think I had better go up to
them, if you will not think me very rude. I am so
sorry this should have happened just now; it is so
unpleasant. But, of course, one cannot help these
things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t apologise, dear,” said Patricia kindly.
“I will amuse myself in the library until Mr. Holmes
has finished his wine. Go to your husband now.
I am sure you ought to be with him. It is very
unfortunate altogether; I do hope Phyllis will soon
be well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should advise you to tell Moore exactly what it
is,” advised Holmes, as the ladies passed across the
threshold. He knew that to keep the Premier in
ignorance of the true nature of the illness would
only serve to make matters worse, since he must
inevitably find out in the course of two or three
hours.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>He smoked his cigar in solitude, a thoughtful
expression on his face. The presence of Lady
Patricia Montella in that household had caused him
a deep sensation of astonishment, for he had not
been aware of her arrival in England. He knew, of
course, that Lady Chesterwood was a connection of
hers by marriage; but even so, he was surprised that
she should be friendly with Moore. Thirsting for
information, he threw down his cigar half smoked,
and rejoined her without delay. Without appearing
unduly curious, he elicited the whole story of her
pathetic separation. Then he inquired after his old
friend, Montella, in almost affectionate terms, and
expressed his regret that Parliament should have lost
such a gifted and true young statesman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I always liked Montella,” he said, when he had
related more than one reminiscence of past years;
“but he had one weakness: he allowed himself to
be ruled by his mother. Now, I have the greatest
respect for Lady Montella, but I do not believe in
petticoat interference. Montella was quite capable
of riding his political horse without the aid of
feminine spurs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are quite right, Mr. Holmes,” assented the
girl, almost surprised at his perception; “but Lady
Montella is a strange woman; she has the spirit of a
Joan of Arc, and the self-discipline of a nun. I have
often wished myself that Lionel were left more to
act on his own initiative. His ideas are on a broader
plane than his mother’s, although he may be less of a
Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite so. Dear me, but how the poor fellow
did scold me for introducing the Assimilation Bill!
And, by Jove! I think he was right. We’ve made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>a ghastly mistake over the whole business, Lady
Patricia. You can tell him so if you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia was all attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean that the result of the Expulsion is
unsatisfactory,” she interrupted eagerly. “I thought
so, judging by all the reports I had heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Cabinet Minister bent forward confidentially.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall I tell you something?” he answered impressively.
“England can <em>not</em> get along without
Jewish money and Jewish brains; and she’s shipped
all the best of it away—sent it to Palestine to enrich
the Holy Land. That’s the plain truth—and a truth
which is going to be expressed pretty forcibly by
the people in Hyde Park next Saturday. Of course,
Moore pooh-poohs it, and means to hold out to the
end; but it strikes me that there will be a fairly
sharp ministerial struggle before long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the result?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, who can tell? I don’t think we have ever
had such a feeble Government as there is now.
There’s scarcely a man among them worth his salt.
Moore still wields that sort of one-man power which
is occasionally beneficial, and at times so dangerous;
and I believe Moore’s mind on the Jewish question
is warped. We’ve got to try and drag that rabid
anti-Semitic feeling out of him: it’s no easy task.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia remembered what Mamie had told her
concerning the Premier’s inmost feelings, and grew
thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if I could do anything to change Mr.
Moore’s opinions,” she said slowly. “I have seen so
much of both sides that I ought to be able to speak
with authority. At present he distrusts me; he has
scarcely spoken a word to me this evening, but of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>course he may have just felt in a taciturn mood. If
I can win him over from anti-Semitism to common
sense, will you excuse the petticoat interference for
once, Mr. Holmes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He smiled good-humouredly at her naïve use of
his own expression, but quickly regained his gravity
as the door opened to admit the Countess. The
unfortunate little lady seemed full of trouble, and
sank on to the settee with an expression of despair.
Athelstan was behaving in a most ridiculous manner,
and declared he would have no trained nurses
creeping about the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He wants me to nurse her myself, with the
assistance of an old and trusted servant of his first
wife’s,” she said, in a voice which was almost tearful.
“He says Phyllis has a horror of strangers. But,
Patricia, how can I? I know I’m not strong, and
I should be sure to catch it. My throat feels quite
sore already at the mere thought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked the picture of misery, with her pale face
and troubled eyes. Patricia wondered that she could
so easily collapse, but taking pity on her, made a
sudden resolve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would Mr. Moore be satisfied if I undertook to
nurse her in your place?” she said impulsively,
without giving herself time to consider the consequence.
“Phyllis will probably remember me; I
am not quite a stranger. And I am a good nurse—I
like it. So if you will have me, I am quite willing
to stay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Lawson Holmes cast her a glance of admiration.
It seemed to him that her beautiful eyes
shone with the light of heroism; and he recognised
that hers was the material of which soldiers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>made. But the Countess could not conceal her
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You!” she exclaimed, starting to her feet. “Oh,
Patricia, you <em>can’t</em> mean it? Why should you do it
for the child of Athelstan Moore? And think of the
responsibility and the risk. Diphtheria is so infectious.
Are you not afraid?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afraid? No.” The girl met her gaze bravely.
“I shall not neglect the necessary precautions, you
may be sure; but even if I do take the disease, it
won’t matter—much. Away from my husband, I
don’t care what happens to me, and that is the very
reason why I shall be immune. Besides, this would
be what Lionel calls a <em>Mitzvah</em>—a good deed which
brings a blessing. Oh, I should like to do it; it
would give me something to occupy my thoughts!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her words unconsciously betrayed the unhappiness
of her present position. Her recklessness with regard
to the danger amounted almost to desperation; and
she seemed to have fully made up her mind. So the
Countess, with a feeling almost of awe, went to
acquaint the Premier of her unselfish offer; she
could not understand her cousin’s frame of mind
in the least.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier manifested not a flicker of surprise.
He returned with his wife to accept the offer with
formal gratitude, but Patricia could see that in
reality he was much stirred. Moreover, it pleased
her to know that he had confidence in her ability,
that he could bring himself to trust her with his
precious child. Realising the tremendous responsibility
she had taken upon herself, she sat down with
trembling hand to write to Mrs. Lowther for what
she required. She could imagine what that good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>lady would say when she read the note, and the
flutter there would ensue at Ivydene. Truly the
situation was a curious one, though not so outrageous
as Mrs. Lowther would make out. But she
had long ago made up her mind that life was full of
the strangest inconsistencies, and had therefore no
compunction in adding one more to the list.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have ordered my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauffeur</span></i> to get the car ready,”
said the Premier, when she had finished the note.
“Will you come with me, Holmes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure.” The Cabinet Minister rose
with alacrity. “You are going to the doctor, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but I haven’t any faith in him—he is only a
local practitioner. I want him to get hold of that
specialist, though—I’ve forgotten the man’s name,
but you know whom I mean. He cured the Crown-Princess
of Germany from the same complaint, and
it was stated at the time that he was the only doctor
in the world who could have pulled her through. I
am certain my little girl will be all right if she is in
his hands, and it will be a great comfort for me to
have him. But I can’t for the life of me think of his
name. It was something beginning with a K.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know!” exclaimed the Countess, glad to be
able to come to the rescue. “It was Dr. Kesten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Moore gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right,” he replied, almost cheerfully.
“Kesten. He’s a splendid doctor, and a really good
and conscientious man. I believe he lives in
Portland Place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dr. Kesten?” repeated Mr. Lawson Holmes, in
astonishment. “Good gracious, Moore, you can’t
have him. He’s in Palestine—one of the victims of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the Expulsion. Have you forgotten that Kesten is a
Jew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia looked up with a startled expression on
her face, and exchanged a glance with Mr. Holmes.
Here indeed was a curious dénouement: Moore was
personally feeling the dire result of his own Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the Premier in his rage and emotion forgot
himself for once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hang the Jews!” was his uncivil, but forcible
remark.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> THE MIND OF THE PREMIER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Patricia found her post no sinecure. The first
thing she did was to send Lady Chesterwood and her
little boy to Ivydene; for Mamie’s fear of infection
was so great that she would most certainly have
caught the disease had she remained, even though
the south wing in which the child lay was quite
apart from the rest of the house. Moore’s foolish
aversion to professional nurses entailed greater
vigilance on the part of the two physicians who
were attending the case, and they were obliged to
visit the Hall three or four times in the course of the
day. In reality the little girl was suffering from a
peculiarly mild form of the disease, but her father
was so nervous that the very pronouncement of the
word “diphtheria” had frightened him beyond
measure. For himself he entertained no fear—his
was too strong a nature to admit of cowardice; but
his love for his child was passionate almost to excess.
Patricia had never seen anything like it in her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>His time was divided between Downing Street, the
House of Commons, and Ravenscroft Hall. At the
Foreign Office he was dictatorial and shrewd; in the
House his speeches lacked nothing of their usual
brilliance; but as soon as he returned to the Hall he
became a different man. The pomposity departed
from him, his step became light, his voice subdued;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and ascending the staircase on tiptoe, the usual
question, “How is she?” fell almost pathetically from
his lips. If she were a little better his happiness
knew no bounds, but if worse, his spirits sank to
zero; and one night, when the child was really in
danger, there ensued a scene which the Hall servants
remembered for months. The doctors would not
allow him to remain in the room, so he paced the
corridor, almost distraught; and as no one dared say a
word to comfort him without the fear of instant dismissal,
he was left to drink his cup of bitterness alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Patricia, coming off duty an hour later, brought
him the welcome news that Phyllis was asleep and
the crisis almost past; and inducing him to accompany
her to the adjoining housekeeper’s room, talked
to him quietly for a little while. She looked pale
from lack of sleep, and her eyes were heavy; but in
his stress of mind and self-absorption he scarcely
spared her a thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you really think she will get better—on your
word of honour?” he asked, for the hundredth time;
“or are you only saying it to comfort me? I don’t
want to be buoyed up by false hopes; I would rather
know the worst. I— Oh dear, how my head seems
to spin! Or is it the room that is going round like
a top?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl helped him to a chair, and forced him to
take a little brandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No wonder you are exhausted,” she said, when he
was somewhat revived. “You are wearing yourself
out; your nerves are constantly on the rack. I don’t
understand you at all, Mr. Moore. In public life you
have the courage and strength of a giant—I have
been reading about you only this morning in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span><cite>Post</cite>; but in private life—here—you behave just like
a nervous woman. I really feel quite ashamed of
you before the doctors. If you do not take care, they
will form a very poor opinion of the Prime Minister’s
fortitude.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke boldly, knowing that the rebuke was
just what he needed, and that it would have a
salutary effect. The Premier regarded her with
astonishment, and a sharp rejoinder rose to his lips;
but he repressed it, and the momentary gleam of
anger died out of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right,” he returned, his hands falling
dejectedly to his side; “but I have had so much
worry lately; I think my nerves are unstrung. And
you don’t know—what it is to love a child—as I love
my Phyllis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes deepened with feeling. “Ah, but I do!”
she said, with a sudden catch in her voice. “I too
have a child—a little darling whom I may never
see again, although he is as dear to me as your little
girl is to you. But I am brave, or at least I try to
be.... And Phyllis will get better. My case is
more hopeless than yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phyllis will get better?” He grasped at the
words as a drowning man clutches a straw. “I pray
God she may! I pray God she may!” Then he
leant his head against his hands, and continued, as
though speaking to himself: “I am not superstitious—a
sensible man has no right to give way to such
folly; but I thought the judgment of Heaven had
fallen when Phyllis was taken ill. The Jews....
They are the bane of my life&#160;... they would pay
me out if they could. Pharaoh oppressed them, and
was smitten with the ten plagues.... But I won’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>be beaten; I <em>won’t</em>.... Not if fifty plagues come on
my people—not if Phyllis dies. <em>If Phyllis dies....</em>
Good God, what am I saying? She must not
die.... Any judgment from Heaven—but not
that&#160;... my one little ewe lamb. Eh?” he added
thickly, as Patricia made a movement. “What was I
talking about? The brandy has got into my head, I
think. Let me go—into the garden; I must have air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stumbled up to the French window, which, by
means of a flight of steps, gave access to the lawn.
Patricia assisted him to descend, and rang hastily for
his valet. Then she returned to the sick-room,
thereby incurring the displeasure of the doctor; for
in the hours that she was not on duty it was necessary
that she should rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am on my way to bed now,” she whispered,
glancing tenderly at the unconscious child; “but I
wanted to tell you something, doctor. Mr. Moore
seems very much unstrung, and I should like you to
prescribe for him before you go. He has to preside
at a Cabinet Meeting to-morrow, and unless he sleeps
to-night, I am sure he will be unable to attend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The physician nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I will, as soon as I have given my
instructions for the night to nurse,” he whispered
back. “And now, Lady Patricia, I must insist on
you going to bed; otherwise, we shall be having
you on the sick-list too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl smiled, and quietly withdrew; but
although she was tired, she felt little inclination for
sleep. The stray glimpse into the secret chambers
of the Premier’s mind had filled her with all sorts of
curious cogitations, and she could not help pondering
on the strange character of the man. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>evidently suffering either from distorted mental vision
or—as Mamie had said—from remorse; and his
recently-grey hair and haggard features testified
that his health was being injured in consequence.
But if that was the case—if his part in connection
with the Expulsion was weighing so heavily on his
mind, why did he not seek to atone for his action by
advocating retractive measures? If he were a brave
man—and his brilliant Parliamentary career proved
him to be a morally strong one—why did he shrink
from owning himself to have been in the wrong? Was
it cowardice or sheer obstinacy which made him hold
on grimly to his original views in spite of his inmost
convictions? And how long would he be able to
maintain that line of conduct—how long before the
great mind would over-balance itself, and travel along
the course which led to insanity? Could it be
possible that they should ever see “<em>that noble and
most sovereign reason, like sweet bells jangled, out of
tune and harsh</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the next morning she found him as abrupt
and self-possessed as usual. All traces of his recent
emotion had disappeared, and he had evidently
regained complete command over himself. The
child had passed a better night, and his matutinal
visit to the sick-room caused him such satisfaction
that he was able to leave for London almost as soon
as the doctor had been. And that day his dialectics
at the Foreign Office were more irresistible than
ever; he was once more his old self, now that the
danger to his child was past.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia found the period of the little girl’s convalescence
more trying than the actual illness, for
there seemed more to do, and Phyllis was often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>peevish and cross. Lady Chesterwood and Mrs.
Lowther called every day, and sometimes twice a
day; but unless she changed all her clothes, for fear
the germs of infection should—according to the
Countess—lurk in the folds of her nursing costume,
she could not see them, and often she was obliged to let
them go away: so that all communication with the
outer world had practically ceased for the present,
and of the daily inquirers who drove up to the Hall
she saw not one. She looked over the visitors’ book
sometimes, and collected the numerous visiting-cards
for Phyllis to play with; but although some of the
names were so familiar that they called up vivid
remembrances of the days of her early girlhood, she
felt no desire to see any of these quondam friends.
Whether they knew of her presence in the Premier’s
mansion she knew not; but it was likely that Mamie
had spread the news.</p>

<p class='c009'>One afternoon, however, a card was brought up to
her which dispelled her usual indifference, and caused
the colour to mount to her cheeks. It bore the
inscription “Sir Ferdinand Montella,” and on the
reverse side the intimation of his immediate return
to Haifa. Scarcely pausing to smooth her fair hair,
Patricia rushed down to receive him; for although
she had never seen him before, she looked upon him
as a link from the East.</p>

<p class='c009'>His visit was the best tonic she could have taken,
for his breezy manner had an exhilarating effect.
He brought good news of her beloved ones in
Palestine, inasmuch as they were both well, and the
baby bonnier than ever. He expressed himself
willing to take back any messages she cared to send,
and apologised deeply for not having come before.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“I was so busy with my affair,” he said, with the
light of satisfaction in his eyes. “Thank goodness
it’s all settled, and I’ve won the case. I was the
cat’s-paw of another fellow, you know; and I could
not have come forward before without betraying him.
But now he is dead, and I have been able to prove
my innocence; and now that I am a free and
honourable man in the sight of the world, I am going
back to marry my little Raie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia held out her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad,” she said sincerely. “I congratulate
you from the bottom of my heart. And I
hope you and Raie will be very happy; she is a
sweet girl, and will make you an admirable wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I think,” he returned, with a glad smile, as his
grasp on her fingers relaxed. “I believe we were cut
out for each other; it was love at first sight, anyway.
But I don’t want to talk about myself, Patricia; I
want to know something about you. Lionel will be
full of questions when I get back. I was astonished
when Mrs. Lowther informed me that you were here.
Whatever made you walk direct into the lion’s
mouth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Providence, or a combination of circumstances,”
she answered slowly. “When I advised Mrs.
Lowther to rent Ivydene for a year, I had quite
forgotten that Ravenscroft Hall was so near; and
you see, Lady Chesterwood was in such trouble that
I was bound to offer to help. I do hope Lionel will
not be angry; I would never have become an inmate
of the Premier’s household under any other circumstances,
and I shall leave as soon as I can. They
have treated me very courteously here; I cannot
complain.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“It seems so strange—so unnecessary,” he said,
with a puzzled expression, “that you, a Montella by
marriage, should go out of your way to nurse the
child of an anti-Semite. It is heaping coals of fire
on his head with a vengeance. I cannot understand
how the man could accept your services if he has any
pride about him at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do not know him, Ferdinand. He has pride,
but he would not let it stand in the way where the
welfare of his child was concerned. Besides, I did it
for Mamie’s sake; her husband was my first-cousin.
And, do you know, I am glad I came. I believe I
shall be able to convert the Premier before I leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Convert the Premier,” he repeated, with an
ironical smile. “What to?—Judaism?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not quite; but you are not far wrong. I want
to cure him of his anti-Semitic mania, and so far I
have progressed well. At first I dare not mention
the Jewish question to him; but now that I have
nursed his child through a serious illness, he is
beginning to trust me, and to listen to what I choose
to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But do you really think that you, a mere woman—I
had almost said child—can influence Athelstan
Moore?” he asked incredulously. “Why, I know
of no one in England who is able to do that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia was too sensible to be piqued by his
scepticism.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do think so,” she returned, with enthusiasm.
“Mr. Moore is a man who can be led, but not
driven. You know what Shakespeare says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘What thou wilt</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than hew to’t with thy sword.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Mr. Lawson Holmes and his colleagues might talk
to him till Doomsday without the slightest effect,
because he is strenuously determined to oppose them;
but I have the opportunity of approaching him in his
tenderest moments—when he is with his child. There
are some cases in which a ‘mere woman’ can do more
than the strongest man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He glanced at her with admiration, not unmixed
with wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if you do cure him of his anti-Semitic mania,
as you call it,” he said slowly, “what will be the
practical result?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot say; but it will be a victory worth
achieving. Everyone knows how the Premier
dominates the Government, both collectively and
individually—how they have not the courage to move
a step without his approval, how they follow him just
like a flock of sheep. Cure him of his anti-Semitism,
and there is no knowing what may happen. Do not
discourage me, Ferdinand, I mean to try very hard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The clock struck four, and warned her that she
was due in the sick-room; but she had so many
messages to send that she could scarcely bear to tear
herself away. If she had only known of his coming,
she would have loaded him with presents for her dear
ones, but he intended to start on the morrow, and it was
too late to get anything now. So she was obliged to
be content with sending her love—so much of it that
Ferdinand laughingly declared he would never be
able to carry it; and she wept a little in spite of his
cheerful words. Then she said good-bye, and went
to her own room for a few minutes to finish her cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>It might be a long time before she saw a Montella
again.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> LADY PATRICIA’S CONQUEST</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Slowly, but surely, Phyllis Moore crept back to
health, and as the danger of infection was over,
Lady Chesterwood and Leslie returned to the Hall.
The child had been ordered to Bournemouth to
recuperate her lost strength, but the weather was so
unfavourable that her father thought it advisable to
wait for a possible improvement. He himself would
not be able to leave London until the Christmas
recess, and was rather glad than otherwise of the
enforced delay.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia was asked to accompany them, in order
that her health might also benefit by the change;
but as her services were no longer required, she
politely but firmly declined. She acknowledged to
Mamie that her stay at Ravenscroft Hall had been
somewhat of a strain; and although she was glad to
have been of use at so urgent a time, she did not care
to remain as the Premier’s guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Athelstan Moore had shown very little appreciation
of her magnanimity during the child’s illness, but as
her stay drew to a close he gradually unbent, and on
the last night he made an effort to express his
gratitude for her kindness. Perhaps he felt more
demonstrative than usual, for all Richmond was
rejoicing at his little daughter’s happy recovery;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>and they had just returned from a crowded thanksgiving
service at the parish church. He took her
into the library after dinner on the pretext of showing
her a particular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">edition de luxe</span></i>, but in reality it was
because he had something to say. He fidgeted
uneasily with his diamond stud, and launched forth
into a long explanation concerning the merits of
his various editions of Shakespeare, whilst Patricia,
knowing that he had not brought her there to discuss
bibliography, waited as patiently as she could.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat down in front of the blazing log-fire, and
watched him from the depths of a heavy arm-chair.
He looked almost handsome that night, in spite of the
lines on his forehead, and seemed to have regained
a little of his former sprightliness. Yet, recollecting
his visit to her father on the day of her marriage, she
recognised a great difference. She remembered how
his short, thick-set figure had bristled with indignation,
and how the steely grey eyes had gleamed.
She remembered his gestures—sharp, stern, commanding,
just as the political caricaturists had
pictured him in their cartoons—but there was little
of that fiery alertness in his bearing now. He
looked like a man who had in some peculiar way
lost all verve: the features, the form, and the voice
remained, but the animation which had given life
to the whole personality was gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abruptly finishing his superfluous dissertation, he
took up his position on the hearthrug, with his back
to the fire, and gazed moodily down at the parquet
floor. Then glancing up suddenly his eye caught
Patricia’s, and his face lit up with the faintest glimmer
of a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to ask you something,” he said, leaning his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>arm against the oaken mantel-shelf. “In reviewing
the events of the last three weeks, it has struck me as
curious that you, of all persons, should have nursed
my little girl, since neither she nor I had the slightest
claim on you. Tell me, Lady Patricia, and do not
be offended at my question—why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” She hesitated. “Oh, because I thought it
was a case in which I could assist. I am always
ready to help <em>anyone</em> in trouble, if I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see. You did it for charity’s sake. If it had
been my lodge-keeper’s child you would have nursed
her with equal willingness and care?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” His exclamation was sharp and gruff.
“Then you did not do it as a personal favour to
me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.” She met his gaze steadily. “I did not do
it for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an uncomfortable pause. He turned
round and gave the fire a vigorous poke, which sent
the flames roaring up the chimney. The light caught
the diamond star at her breast, and set it scintillating
with prismatic rays. Then with his eyes almost
involuntarily set on the jewel, he addressed her again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is as well to know the truth,” he said, with
feigned nonchalance. “Otherwise I might have
flattered myself that you nursed Phyllis for my
sake. I suppose, in reality, you consider me more
of an enemy than a friend?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I have reason to do so,” she returned, with
a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On account of the Jewish question?” he asked
slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“I am sorry.” He spread his hands deprecatingly.
“But you see it is not my fault that you happened to
marry a Jew. You know I have no love for that
race.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do know, to my sorrow,” she answered quietly.
“But I cannot understand it at all. Mr. Moore, why
are you an anti-Semite?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The question was given with such direct simplicity
that for a moment he was at a loss for a reply. This
was carrying the war into the enemy’s country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why am I an anti-Semite?” he repeated, with
hesitation. “Well, that is too large a matter to be
entered into now. My motives are both political
and personal; but they can be summed up in one
sentence: I hate the Jews.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet you call yourself a Christian!” she said,
with contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>His cheeks flushed. “Lady Patricia!” he exclaimed,
half angrily; but she was undismayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do call yourself a Christian,” she continued
calmly. “You are publicly known as one of the
staunchest of churchmen, and you are president of
several church societies. Mr. Moore, did Christ hate
the Jews?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was silence, but she scarcely waited for a
response. “You know He did not,” she went on
quickly. “He healed them of their diseases, toiled
for them, suffered for them, died for them, loved them
to the end. To be at the same time a Christian
and an anti-Semite is absolutely impossible. More:
if England is anti-Semitic, she cannot be Christian,
and (I quote from one of your own speeches now)—the
day England ceases to be Christian she ceases
to be great. Oh, cannot you see the inconsistency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>of your position? How could you reconcile it with
your conscience to persecute the Jews?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She raised her sweet face in passionate appeal.
The words seemed to come direct from her heart,
and her ardour expressed itself in the depths of her
blue eyes. Moore stared at her with unconcealed
astonishment. No one—not even his friend Lawson
Holmes—had dared to be so outspoken; but this
gentle girl evidently was not afraid. And her words
struck home: they pierced the outer shield of his
obstinacy, and penetrated to the true self within;
they touched the inmost chords of his troubled
emotions, and set them quivering like the strings of
a lyre. Yet he displayed no resentment, rather was
he abashed: for his usual flow of language deserted
him; he could, for once, find no counter-reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Persecution is an accommodating term,” he said,
at last. “Place the smallest restriction on the liberty
of a sect, and immediately they proclaim themselves
martyrs. We have no desire to ‘persecute’ the
Jews; we have used neither the knout nor the rack.
For myself, all I desire is to eliminate everything
Jewish from our English life; nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To eliminate everything Jewish?” she repeated,
unable to conceal a touch of scorn. “Why, it cannot
be done; the Jews have left too great an impress on
the world. Religion, history, science, the fine arts,
commerce, is there anything in which they have
never had a place? We went to church this
evening: was your enjoyment of the anthem
marred because the music was composed by
Mendelssohn, a Jew? And has it ever occurred to
you that our Liturgy is almost entirely of Jewish
origin? The <em>Magnificat</em>—what is it but the joy-song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of a Jewish maiden?—the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc Dimittis</span></i>, that of
Simeon the Jew? Why, the whole Bible belongs to
the Jews—is Jewish literature from Genesis to
Revelations. And yet you would eliminate everything
Jewish from your thoughts. As well try to
wipe out the past and re-create the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused as the door opened to admit the
Countess, who was tired of her own society, and
wondered what the two could be talking about.
Mamie considered it selfish of her husband to
monopolise the girl’s company on the last night of
her stay; but noticing the gravity of his expression,
she conquered her desire to tell him so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you have thanked Patricia nicely for her
kindness to Phyllis,” she said, with complacence, as
she settled herself in the opposite arm-chair. “Have
you decided what form the memento is to take?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her husband looked almost disconcerted. “Not
yet,” he returned dryly. “When I led up to the
subject we both went off at a tangent; however,
the evening is yet young.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We want to give you a little souvenir of your
visit,” Mamie explained eagerly; “but we could not
decide as to what it should be, so we thought we
had better ask you. I suggested a crescent brooch
to replace the one you gave to the Unemployed.
Do you remember that day, Patricia? What a
tender-hearted goose you were!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia’s colour rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very good,” she said, addressing them
both, and inwardly determining not to accept any
reward for her services, however delicately it might be
offered. “But I really have more jewellery than I
can wear already. I would rather not have a present,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>if you don’t mind; indeed, I haven’t the faintest idea
what to choose. I have all I want.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier seemed to be turning over something
in his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All you want?” he repeated slowly; “except—your
husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamie cast him a sharp glance of interrogation,
but he took no notice, and advanced towards his
guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Patricia,” he said impressively, “you do
want your husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Want him?” She choked down a sob. “Yes, I
do want him; I long for him night and day! But
you are unkind: don’t tease me, Mr. Moore!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tears welled up in her eyes, and gathered
slowly on her beautiful lashes. She felt as if he were
playing with her as a cat plays with a mouse, and
her whole being rose in revolt at such a lack of
generous feeling. But the Premier’s features showed
no sign of intended satire; he had evidently spoken
in perfect faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not teasing you,” he said, in a peculiarly
quiet voice. “Patricia, I have to make an important
decision before ten o’clock to-morrow morning. A
month ago I should have given my answer without
the slightest hesitation, but now—now I see that things
are different to what they appeared a little while ago.
Supposing the Edict of Expulsion were cancelled,
would your husband return?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Edict cancelled!” She could scarcely
believe her ears. “Do you mean that England will
open her doors to the Jews again?” she asked, in a
tone of excitement. “Oh, it seems too good to be
true; I can scarcely believe it.” She took a deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>breath. “Of course Lionel would come back; Haifa
would soon empty itself of its English population.
But, Mr. Moore, is it true? Do you really—<em>really</em>
mean it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a possibility,” he returned, as though with
an effort. “Statistics show that trade and commerce
have deteriorated since the Expulsion; and the people
are clamouring for the Jews’ return. To-morrow the
question comes up in Parliament, and I shall make a
speech either for or against. My colleagues, knowing
my views, anticipate my opposition; but—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will surprise them all by supporting the
resolution,” she interpolated quickly. “Mr. Moore,
you know the Expulsion Act has been a weight on
your mind ever since it was put into force; you
know that it was all a gross miscarriage of justice.
If the Jews have suffered through it, so has England,
so have you. Here is a Heaven-sent opportunity to
retrieve your mistake!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Premier winced, scarcely relishing such frank
condemnation. If he were obliged to drink the cup
of defeat he shrank from having it offered in that
way. But Patricia had conquered; and the long
arguments in which she had so patiently engaged
with him all through his child’s convalescence were
about to bear fruit. She had known all along that
her insistent pleading was making some little
impression on his stubborn heart; but she had never
dared to think that he would so easily surrender.
Her questions fell thick and fast as she considered
the details of the proposed repeal, and she volunteered
more than one pertinent remark. The Premier
sighed as he noticed her flushed cheeks and sparkling
eyes; for what was to her a cause of profound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>joyfulness, meant to him a great renunciation.
Perhaps the girl never knew what the abandonment
of his principles really cost him; it was like an
upheaval of his whole political life.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nearly twelve o’clock before they parted for
the night, and even then Patricia seemed inclined to
linger. Hope had sprung up anew within her breast,
and the thought of her husband’s probable return
invested her with fresh life and energy. She listened
to Mamie’s cheerful prognostication of the future with
a happy smile, never thinking that her elation perhaps
jarred upon her host. But when the clock struck the
hour she approached him to say good-night, and the
gladness on her face grew more subdued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, Mr. Moore,” she said, holding out
her hand. “I am sorry if I hurt you by what I said
before, and if—if you will have me as a friend—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bent over the hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly we are friends, Patricia,” he answered
quietly, with an involuntary sigh. “Moore—the
anti-Semite—is dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Mr. Moore the Christian statesman lives!”
She glanced into his face with shining eyes. “Oh, I
am so glad—so glad! I feel as if I could sing a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te
Deum</span></i> of praise!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>THE LAST CHAPTER<br /> <span class='large'>THE SKIRT OF A JEW</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So the English nation decided that it was more to
their advantage to “take hold of the skirt of him
that is a Jew” than to avoid him altogether; and
the Expulsion Act was eventually repealed. But
Parliament was too wary to fall into the old error of
allowing unrestricted immigration, and determined to
keep the pauper alien away from English shores.
Fortunately this class was rapidly becoming extinct,
for in the Holy Land there was work and a welcome
for all, and the term “pauper alien” would soon be
as worn out as the dodo. Moreover, the establishment
of the Jews in Palestine meant an end to the
atrocities to which they had been subjected from
time to time in Eastern Europe: for in their own
land they were at least free. And even though the
English population flowed steadily back to the
dearly-loved native country, there were still enough
Jews in Palestine to promote the general welfare of
the Jewish State. Indeed, the return of the Jews to
England proved a beneficial check to the threatened
overcrowding of the towns.</p>

<p class='c009'>Haifa—as Patricia had predicted—soon lost its
English citizens, and Lionel Montella found it easy
to resign his post. His mother, preferring to remain
in the Holy Land, went to live with Dr. and Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Engelmacher in Jerusalem, but intended to visit
England once a year. The others made preparations
to leave in the ensuing April; perhaps they were less
susceptible to the claims of ancestry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia’s joy knew no bounds, and she was so busy
preparing for their return that the intermediate
months seemed to have taken wings. With generous
magnanimity her husband renounced the ownership
of Burstall Abbey in favour of his step-brother; and
she had been commissioned to see that the place was
prepared for the reception of Sir Ferdinand and his
bride. Lionel himself intended to stay at Ivydene,
prior to purchasing a new and suitable town-house
near Piccadilly, for Patricia had refused her father’s
offer of his mansion for the whole of the forthcoming
season. So she occupied herself in beautifying the
villa so far as its dimensions would allow, and spared
no pains to make it as attractive as possible. She
called Mrs. Lowther into the nursery one day to see
the alterations she had made, and leaning against the
dappled back of the rocking-horse, gave vent to the
rapture which burned within her breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To think that in a week’s time my little Julian
will be here!” she exclaimed, with joy. “And I
thought when I left him that I should not see him
for years!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she proceeded to relate a pretty little
anecdote of his infancy; for nothing gave her greater
pleasure than to talk about her boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked so fair and radiant that Mrs. Lowther
could not help congratulating her on her improved
appearance. She went singing about the house as
blithely as a lark, and the careworn expression on
her face had entirely disappeared. The greater part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>of her time was spent in the company of the Princess,
who, with her husband, had just arrived on a visit to
Ravenscroft Hall. Her Highness was delighted at
the turn affairs had taken, and expressed keen
satisfaction that her prophecy had been fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you I guessed the separation would not be
for long, didn’t I?” she said, when they first met;
“but tell me, Pat, how are you going to arrange
matters about Lionel’s Judaism now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, and I don’t care,” the girl rejoined,
a ring of defiance in her voice; “there will be time
enough to worry about that later on. Besides, Lady
Montella means to stay in Jerusalem, so I shall feel
comparatively free.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You always speak of your respected mother-in-law
as if she were a kind of policeman,” said Lady
Chesterwood, smiling. “Was her interference really
so terrible as all that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. You see Lady Montella is very nice, and
one of the kindest and most religious women in the
world, but her rigid Judaism is very difficult to get
on with. To be honest, I am glad that she is making
her home in Jerusalem; it is the best place for her
under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I could send my mother-in-law to
Jerusalem!” remarked the Princess feelingly. “She
is always doing her utmost to upset my poor Karl.
We have decided to stay away from Felsen-Schvoenig
as long as we possibly can; but if we could ship her
off to the Holy Land we might be able to go back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whereupon they agreed that there ought to be a
special place for unwanted mothers-in-law; and talked
a great deal of nonsense to that effect.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>And so the time went on, until the long-looked-for
day of the Montellas’ return dawned at last. Patricia
was up with the birds, thankful for the spring sunshine
which streamed through the windows, and
seemed to typify to her the brightness of her coming
future. Directly after breakfast her friends from
Ravenscroft Hall brought her some of the choicest
flowers out of the Premier’s conservatories, and gaily
helped her to fill the rooms. But they considerately
refused the invitation to accompany her to the station,
thinking she would prefer to meet her people alone.
They remained until the hour of departure, and then
drove back to the Hall, the Countess making Patricia
promise to bring her husband to see the Premier at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>In spite of her careful calculations, the expectant
wife arrived at the station only just in time. The
continental train came steaming into the terminus
just as her brougham drew up alongside the platform,
and the usual bustle and shouting of porters
immediately ensued. Patricia looked about her in
bewilderment, but in another moment she was
surrounded by the party she sought. Sir Ferdinand
and his happy young bride; Mrs. Emanuel—elated at
the thought of returning to her beloved Canonbury—with
her little brood; baby Julian fast asleep in the
arms of the faithful Anne; and last but not least,
Lionel Montella, looking pale and somewhat thin,
but happy withal. Patricia received her husband’s
embrace in silence, unable to say a word; but he
knew that her heart was full with a joy too deep for
utterance, and her hand-clasp meant more to him
than the choicest of flowery speeches.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until they had parted from the others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>and were driving back to Richmond, that she
remembered a non-arrival amongst the party.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought Zillah Lorm intended to come, too,” she
said half wonderingly. “Did she leave you on the
way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Montella exchanged a glance with Anne.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, darling, she left us on the way,” he returned,
with a sigh. “Poor Zillah! It is very sad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something in his tone arrested the girl’s attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean, dear?” she asked, with
hesitation. “Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The poor unfortunate woman threw herself overboard
soon after we left Port Said, my lady,” said
Anne, as her master did not reply. “She was
drowned almost before anyone knew, and the
Lascars tried in vain to recover her body. Oh,
dear, what excitement there was on the boat! We
were all that upset we could talk of nothing else for
days, she being such a comely young person and all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I should think. But how dreadful! Poor
girl!” Her eyes filled. “What made her put such
a terrible end to her life? Was she unhappy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid so, dear,” replied Montella quietly.
“She seemed to have no aim in life, and to find
everything as Dead Sea fruit. She was always
pessimistic and despondent. I believe she wanted
to return to England some months ago, and only
remained for my mother’s sake; yet when we eventually
started, she expressed no pleasure at the thought
of going home. On board the vessel she became
engaged to an English officer, but quarrelled with
him the night before her death. Whether that had
anything to do with her suicide, however, we shall
never know. It is unspeakably sad.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>It was indeed sad, and Patricia could not help
thinking about it for days. It seemed such a potent
example of the consequence of a life unsustained by
faith. She knew that poor Zillah Lorm had believed
neither in God nor her fellow-creatures, and that to
her the world had been naught but a great charnelhouse
of crushed and moribund desires. But she
was unable to imagine the agony of mind which had
caused the unhappy girl to throw herself into the
sea. The tragedy scarce bore contemplation; its
secret reason would remain a mystery to the end.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not wishing to mar her husband’s home-coming by
the expression of gloomy sentiments, she avoided the
subject after she had learnt the news. Arrived at
Ivydene, little Julian awoke from his sleep just in
time for tea, and delighted the mother’s heart by his
display of recognition and affection. Full of happiness,
she assisted Anne to put him to bed, lingering
by his little cot until he visited slumberland once
more. Then she descended to spend a quiet evening
with her husband <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>; for Mrs. Lowther
considerately went to dine out with a friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not cold, but they had a fire lit for comfort’s
sake, and watched the cheerfully blazing embers as
they talked. They had so much to say that they
scarcely knew where to begin, and enjoyed each
other’s presence in silence for a little while. Patricia
felt like a child who, after long waiting, had found
its lost protector, and sat with her head nestled
contentedly against Lionel’s shoulder. Presently,
however, her curiosity got the better of her; there
were so many things she wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>He answered her questions concerning his doings
in Palestine with gentle patience. Their enemy, Ben
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Yetzel, had conquered, in so far as rigid orthodoxy
throughout the Holy Land was to prevail, and he
had had more than one skirmish with the Rabbi
since she had taken her departure. Dr. Engelmacher,
good-humoured and pliant as usual, had accepted
the dictum with cheerful resignation, deeming it
wiser to sacrifice his own view of the matter for the
sake of peace. Most of the English people who
availed themselves of the repealing of the Act retained
a financial interest in Palestine, which would result in
a constant communication between the two countries.
The outlook on Jewish affairs, therefore, was of the
brightest, and more promising than it had been since
the time of the First Dispersion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Lady Montella?” asked Patricia, when he
had finished. “Did she approve of your returning
to England and me, or would she have been better
pleased if you had remained out there in spite of the
cancelling of the Edict?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not sure, dear,” was her husband’s reply.
“My mother is so fond of the Holy Land that she
would have been delighted had I chosen to stay; but
I should have been more than human had I remained
under those circumstances. When the path which
led to you became easy, how could I refrain from
taking it? Only an exaggerated sense of duty
would have made me act otherwise. Besides I
wanted you so much, my darling. Those eight
months of our separation were the hardest of my
life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And of mine,” she added softly, with a fervent
pressure of his hand. “But, Lionel, I am surprised
that your mother allowed you to bring baby Julian
back to me. She seemed to think that I had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>further right to him since I could not teach him
orthodox Judaism.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I took the law into my hands in this instance,
dear,” he answered, dispelling the pucker on her brow
with a kiss. “I told her that Julian was your child
as well as mine, and that I was determined you
should educate him in accordance with your conscience
until he grew old enough to choose for himself.
Besides, there’s Ferdinand now to keep up the
old traditions of the House; and as he has married a
Jewess, we can reasonably hope for a Jewish heir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you will not expect me to feign Judaism
any more?” she asked wistfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not. We shall settle the question by
introducing a Jewish housekeeper to do all that
is necessary. I have thoroughly made up my mind
that the difference-in-creed bogey shall never come
between us again. I am a Jew, and you are a
Christian, and so long as we do our duty according
to our respective convictions, no one has a right to
expect any more. Thank God, there is now neither
a fanatical Chief Rabbi nor a foolish Assimilation
Act to interfere. We are free at last, and in such
freedom there is happiness for us both. Set your
mind at rest, my dear one; the troubles of the past
can never return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Patricia gave a sigh of relief as she gazed into
the heart of the fire. How broad-minded he was,
and noble, and true!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear boy!” she exclaimed softly. “I am the
happiest creature in the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The heaviness which endured for a night had
been replaced by the joy of the morning. She felt
that the suffering of the past months was as nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>compared with the happiness which had dawned
at last.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c009'>They went to Ravenscroft Hall before the end
of the week to pay their respects to the Premier
and his wife. It was quite a summer’s day—one
which had wedged itself into April by a meteorological
mistake—and they found their friends enjoying
tea on the lawn. Lady Chesterwood presided,
assisted by her sister, whilst Prince Karl pretended
to be a waiter, to the intense delight of Phyllis and
Leslie. The new-comers were provided with tea, and
urged by the children to tip the waiter for his
attention; after which they suddenly discovered
Raie behind a neighbouring tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to give you a surprise,” she said
laughingly, as she came forward and joined the
group. “Ferdinand is indoors talking to Mr. Moore.
We came over to Richmond this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you did not find time to visit us?” said
Patricia, aggrieved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we went with mamma and Harriet to the
Isaacson’s to lunch,” was her apologetic reply.
“Mamma insists on taking us to see all her friends;
it is such a novelty for her to possess a married
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not add that Mrs. Emanuel was so proud
of “my daughter Lady Ferdinand” that she was
anxious to exhibit her to all and sundry. She was
so happy that what might have jarred upon her in
other circumstances simply caused her amusement
now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you intend to do with the she-dragon,
Pat?” asked Mamie, when the conversation turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>on domestic affairs. “I suppose her services as
lady-companion will no longer be required.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Patricia smiled. “I have two dear companions of
my own now,” she answered happily. “I shall have
to find Mrs. Lowther another berth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send her to Jerusalem,” suggested the Princess
naïvely; and Raie, unable to see the point of the
remark, wondered why they laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel left them to finish their tea without him,
and strolled through the grounds towards the house.
The French windows at the north side stood invitingly
open, and ascending the short flight of steps, he
entered the room. It happened to be the Premier’s
library, and the shelves which lined the four walls
were filled with books. In one corner stood a large
writing-table, littered with documents of various
descriptions; and above it hung a beautifully painted
panel mounted in oak, and inscribed with a lengthy
quotation from Shakespeare. Not caring to linger
near the open bureau, Montella would have passed
on; but the old English letters with their illuminated
points attracted his attention, and half wondering
what would be the substance of the Premier’s motto,
he paused a moment to read:</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Salarino</span>—Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt
not take his flesh; what’s that good for?</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Shylock</span>—To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing
else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses, mocked
at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what’s his
reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not
a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same
weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and
summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not
bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us,
do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? revenge;
if a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be
by Christian example? why, revenge. The villainy you
teach me, I will execute; and it shall go hard, but I will
better the instruction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So this was the lesson which Athelstan Moore had
set himself to learn! Lionel could scarcely repress
an exclamation of surprise as his eye ran over the
inscription. As in a flash, the revelation of what
Moore’s inward struggle must have meant burst in
upon him; and he recognised the courage the great
man had shown even in his defeat. Full of thought,
the young champion of the Jews turned thoughtfully
away, to be met by the Premier himself before he
reached the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment of embarrassing silence as
the two men confronted one another. The thoughts
of both went back to the time of their antagonism,
when hot and bitter words had been spoken on either
side. But the Prime Minister was not long before
he recovered himself, and with a softened light
in his usually brilliant eyes, he held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Welcome back to England, Montella,” he said, in
a quiet but hearty voice. “We parted as enemies,
but I trust we meet as friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel gripped his hand like a true Briton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I trust so,” he returned, noticing almost with a
pang of compunction how grey and old he looked.
“It was never my wish to quarrel with you, Mr.
Moore, but I could not help being a Jew.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“Of course you couldn’t.” He glanced towards the
panel with a sigh. “And I know you are proud of
it, too. We’ve been taught a hard lesson during your
absence, Montella. Anti-Semitism doesn’t answer in
England, and it never will; for it’s a savage and
retrograde movement, incompatible both with our
Christianity and our advanced state of civilisation.
Strange that we had to have an Expulsion in order
to find that out! The simplest truths are the most
difficult to learn, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are, sometimes,” acquiesced the young man,
with respect; “but we had better forget the past,
Mr. Moore. The Jew—in spite of popular tradition—does
not bear malice, and now that our beloved
England has returned our freedom to us, I am sure
we shall be greater friends than ever before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God grant we may!” was the Premier’s fervent
reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was no longer an enemy of the Jews. He had
become their staunch ally.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
